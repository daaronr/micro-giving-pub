# Notes for (Beem101 Microeconomics) students; overview {-#note}

**Notes by instructor [David Reinstein](davidreinstein.wordpress.com/)**

```{r  fig.cap = 'Famous photograph by Ansel Adams, who loved black and white photography, colorised using Jason Antic\'s de-oldify', out.width='50%', fig.asp=.4, fig.align='center',  echo = FALSE}
 knitr::include_graphics("picsfigs/ansel_halfdome_coloronly.png")
```


## Reading and using this web-book {-}

```{block2,  type='note'}

This web book is designed to be read on on a computer or a tablet (an iPad works well, I imagine other tablets will also work). But it is not designed for a mobile phone. Nor is it easy to 'printed out and read', or read on an e-reader (Kindle etc) in its current format. There are a lot of 'folds' that need to be opened to get the most out of this.  I am working on making it available as a pdf, but this will take some time to do.

```


## Focus and style of this module {-#focus}

<!--
*Note: [In the next section](#outline), I give a brief---and then a descriptive---outline of the 'story of this module' and the we will consider... and why these are interesting.*
-->

\

**This is...**

1. a **Microeconomics** module.  We will learn and use maths and rigorous logic to consider deep questions of:
- Individual preferences, choices and optimization subject to constraints
- How individuals interact with one another, and the consequences of this (Game theory and mechanism design/agency problems)
- "Markets", prices, and "welfare" (how much value is created, who gets what, how do we consider these outcomes as a society)
- Psychological influences on the above, and limits to optimization (Behavioral Economics)

\


2. a  **Selective and bespoke** module

We will not cover 'all of Microeconomics'.  I will **focus on a limited set of concepts, models and application**s (and academic articles) that I hope you will find most interesting and useful.

We will skip many major important topics. But that's OK. We will learn tools, 'modes of thinking', and 'modes of proving results' that should strengthen your brain muscles and help you understand a much wider body of material.

- I often focus on models with 'surprising' or 'counter-intuitive' results. If you can explain the logic behind these (as well as the maths), you have achieved an understanding beyond a layman's intuition.

- I will try to incorporate a small set *applications* that are particularly relevant to your careers and your research interests.
,
<div class="marginnote">
I may also try to incorporate data, statistics/empirical modeling, and 'computer coding' because these will be super-important in your career.
</div>

*Please give me feedback on what you are interested in.*


3. an **Inquisitive module**: we ask **the 'how?', 'why?', 'so what?', and 'is this reasonable?'** ... of the models and concepts

When studying Economics, I often saw models presented, with strong assumptions, without any explanation of what these were for and how they could be justified. In this module we will always be skeptical and carefully ask 'what is the purpose' of each model and concept.

<div class="marginnote">
For example, 'what does it mean to say that something is a mixed-strategy Nash equilibrium?' ... Do we expect people to actually randomise in this way?
</div>



## Level of this module {-#level}

This module is adapted to students from a variety of backgrounds.


For students interested in pursuing a PhD in Economics, and interested in research:

- We will cover some approaches and relevant building blocks, and I will point you to relevant materials for further enrichment
- I will incorporate content from academic literature ('articles in peer reviewed journals') and sophisticated research considerations
- I will incorporate my own research, research methods, and 'really getting our hands dirty' in digging into research questions, building theoretical (maths) models, and even perhaps experiments, coding, and data analysis.
- We will discuss *your* proposed research, relate microeconomic theory and models to this, and bring this into coursework
- I will try to help you 'think, research and write' like a good economist. (See my [Writing and research guide here](https://daaronr.github.io/writing_econ_research/about-this-work.html)).

\

*However, please note that will not fully prepare you for doctoral study and academic research that requires advanced Microeconomics. MRes programmes and modules are better geared to this.*


\

For students coming from backgrounds with limited Economics training and limited abstract maths:

- I will explain most concepts 'from the ground up', or point you to what you will need to revise.

- I will present most material *also* at an intermediate level, using diagrams and simple intuition.

<div class="marginnote">
But note that you need to have SOME background in Economics to do well in this module. This is an MSc-level Economics module, after all.
</div>


\

For students who are not as fluent in English as they would like to be (perhaps many/most of our students):

- I will try to communicate clearly and at a reasonable pace, avoiding slang and using diagrams and maths to convey ideas

- Most of what I say in lectures/videos/tutorials is also in writing here in this web book (or in links)

- I will strongly encourage you to participate actively and try to help you improve your English communication skills.

- Interacting with  my [Writing and research guide here](https://daaronr.github.io/writing_econ_research/introduction.html) should also be helpful for this (and for your dissertation, if you will be writing one).


## Readings and resources {-#readings}

This module will use a variety of resources: I will guide you through this via the online text that you are reading now.. **Consider this the 'governing resource'.**

This draws heavily from several texts and other resources, **all of which are free and available online**. I will make it clear what come from where, and where you can find additional readings.

In particular:

1. "O-R": [Models in Microeconomic Theory, by Osborne and Rubinstein](https://www.openbookpublishers.com/product/1171)



```{r  fig.cap = '', out.width='50%', fig.asp=.4, fig.align='center',  echo = FALSE}
 knitr::include_graphics("picsfigs/models-text-cover.png")
```


> Our main aim is to give the reader an understanding of the concepts of model and equilibrium in microeconomic theory

This book is very precise, abstract (in a mathematical sense), and extremely well-written and full of wisdom and insight. It is *dense*; don 't worry if it takes you a long time to digest each concept (but if you get stuck, please do ask questions and try different approaches).  It is the most relevant (at least of these three) for further postgraduate/PhD study.

The authors claim 'the mathematics we use is elementary'. However, I think it contains a deep sort of maths that you will find challenging. As they say, 'many of the proofs involve sustained logical arguments'.


2. [Introduction to Economic Analysis version 2.1 by McAfee, Lewis, and Dale](https://www.scholars.northwestern.edu/en/publications/introduction-to-economic-analysis-v21)

This is a more traditional text, with more 'computational-style' problems. It covers a wider set of Economics concepts than the others.


3. "QMC": [Quantum Microeconomics with Calculus](http://www.smallparty.org/yoram/quantum/quantumcalc.pdf) by Yoram Baumann, the self-proclaimed 'World's First Standup Economist'

This is somewhat less rigorous than O-R, but it has its own strengths. It approaches the material in an unusual way, and covers some material that is not traditionally covered in Economics courses (and skips many core concepts).

As I am incorporating some material *directly* from these works, I include the licences below (in the fold).

```{block2,  type='fold'}

- We also make use of academic articles and working papers as well as some of my own writings... these are mentioned below

\

### Other relevant resources {-#other-reseources}

**Simpler resources** (unfold if interested)


```{block2,  type='fold'}

- Varian, Hal R., Intermediate microeconomics: a modern approach. New York, NY: WW Norton & Company, 2010: Somewhat less formal than O-R but it also covers a wider set of material and computations.

- Intermediate Microeconomics and its Application (an Undergraduate text) by Nicholson and Snyder. We have used this for a good chunk of this module in past years. It is at a very basic level, in terms of the maths. Free online access to this text may be available through your university/library (this works at Exeter) via [www.vlebooks.com](https://www.vlebooks.com/)

- A free alternative, at a similar level: [Microeconomics an Open Text by Douglas Curtis and Ian Irvine](https://open.umn.edu/opentextbooks/textbooks/microeconomics-markets-methods-and-models)

-  Microeconomics by Hugh Gravelle and Ray Rees (version 3, widely available online for free):  A somewhat more advanced-intermediate-level text which I think you will find very useful; this is not yet officially Open-Source, but you can find it online for free (and the authors are OK with this, I have emailed them). Just do a web search for 'Gravelle and Rees Microeconomics' and you will find the pdf

```

\

**More rigorous, advanced and applied work will draw from**

- David Autor’s MIT Open Courseware “Microeconomic Theory and Public Policy”; [all the files for this course can be downloaded here](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/economics/14-03-microeconomic-theory-and-public-policy-fall-2016/lecture-notes/); this will give you a flavor of the PhD level micro.

## About this web-book: the Governing Resource {-#this-book}

**Welcome to the exciting world of Microeconomics**

I wrote this web-book to outline all of the material you are responsible for,  and to give you more resources and insight than I can convey in the short  amount contact time that we have.   I *don't* mean you're simply responsible for material in these printed notes:  I mean that these notes will aim to *refer to* everything that you are responsible for.

This web-book is meant to be a complement to the texts and readings (and to  lectures/videos,  tutorials/problem sets and other material on the module web site) and to tie all of this together.

<!-- I am providing you these notes both as a complete file as well as divided by lecture week (approximately). Use either version.
-->

 I will try my best to stick to the structure outlined in this web-book.  However, things may adjust slightly as we go and I will need to make updates to this as we go along.  I will keep you informed of any changes via the ELE (VLE) forums and the ELE page in general.

<br> \bigskip

*Web-book versus slides?: (unfold)*

```{block2,  type='fold'}

At times I will present material using slides.  This web-book should include all of the slide material *plus* explanatory notes and enrichment material. (However, I left out some of the jokes.) I use some abbreviations before certain notes to help you understand how to digest this.  I will also  make the slides themselves available even though they are redundant– this web-book has everything that slides have.

```

<br> \bigskip


### 'Markers', abbreviations, and callouts/boxes {-#markers}

- OR:  Osborne and Rubinstein's [Models in Microeconomic Theory](https://www.openbookpublishers.com/product/1171)


- 'McDL' refers to the [McAfee, Dale and Lewis text](https://www.scholars.northwestern.edu/en/publications/introduction-to-economic-analysis-v2)

- 'QMC' refers to ['Quantum Microeconomics with Calculus'](http://www.smallparty.org/yoram/quantum/quantumcalc.pdf)  (Baumann)

- 'DA' refers to [David Autor's MIT open courseware notes for Microeconomic Theory and Public Policy](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/economics/14-03-microeconomic-theory-and-public-policy-fall-2016/lecture-notes/)



<!--
- 'LC' indicates a lecturer comment I may make in lecture that you don't need to worry about (I meant to cut these but I sometimes forget to)

`r format_with_col("Text in this color usually refers to questions you should  try to answer on your own (and I sometimes provide suggested answers in a folding box or footnonte. Try to answer it yourself first.)","brown")`

`r format_with_col("Some text may be  given in gray to indicate that this is a side point or a discussion.","gray")`

-->

- **'Comprehension Q:'** A question you should be able to answer if you are following along.


\


**Margin notes:**

(Look on the right... $\rightarrow$)

<div class="marginnote">
These reflect brief comments, hints, side points, or reference links.

</div>


\

**Folding boxes:**

I will occasionally put additional material in boxes that can be unfolded. Sometimes I do this with "question and answer" so you've an opportunity to consider the answer before peeking. I also will do this with some material that involves a side conversation, or material that is very tangential, and would otherwise clutter up the text.

Look in the fold:

```{block2,  type='fold'}

Greetings from the fold! The weather is nice in here.
```

<!---
batch file: 'bash \$HOME/"Google Drive/exeter_teaching/be2024/compileslidesnotes.sh"'
-->


```{block2,  type='note'}

I will use these boxes for 'notes' expressing material that is important, but is somewhat 'aside' from the main content.
```

```{block2,  type='tip'}

This color of box is used for 'hints and tips'.

```

```{block2,  type='warning'}

Boxes like this indicate 'warnings' ... usually highlighting ways that students often *misunderstand* particular content.

```



\

### Leaving comments and asking questions *within this book* using Hypothes.is {-#hypoth}

As you read this book, you can

- put comments/question right in the text,

- see and respond to other's questions/comments (these should be highlighted in yellow and)

- see my answers and responses (I will periodically check this),

- leave comments and answer specific questions asked in the text, offering me valuable feedback.

You can do this using a browser tool called [hypothes.is](https://web.hypothes.is/) (you can go to their site to learn more about this tool).   Sign up for a [hypothes.is account](https://hypothes.is/signup) (this takes 2 minutes and it's free).

<div class="marginnote">

It will be better if you get an account that identifies you to me, so I can follow up with individual feedback and learn more about who you are. However, it's also fine if you want to make your account ID basically anonymous... or you could even get two accounts,  if you prefer.

You don't need to install anything. However, if you install the Hypothes.is plugin for your browser this will give you the additional ability to leave comments on other sites and start private groups.

</div>

**To add a comment or question**

After you've an account (and you are signed in), to add a comment or ask a question here, just:

1. Highlight some text



```{r  fig.cap = 'highlighting text', out.width='65%', fig.asp=.4, fig.align='center',  echo = FALSE}
 knitr::include_graphics("picsfigs/hyp_select.png")
```

2. Click the 'annotate' icon that comes up
3. Write your comment or question

- Write your question in the box (see icons to use math notation and other features)
- Please add the tag 'beem101' to help others search for this.
- Click 'post to public'


```{r  fig.cap = '', out.width='55%', fig.asp=.4, fig.align='center',  echo = FALSE}
 knitr::include_graphics("picsfigs/hyp_comment.png")
```

- I will periodically browse and respond.


\

**To view existing comments/questions from yourself and others**

- You should see these highlighted in yellow if you are signed in (I think), as well as with little markers with the number '1' on that sidebar


```{r  fig.cap = '', out.width='40%', fig.asp=.4, fig.align='center',  echo = FALSE}
 knitr::include_graphics("picsfigs/sidebar_hyp.png")
```


- If you click the 'eyeball' on the side you can turn this off and on
- If you click the 'paper' on the sidebar, you can open up and see the existing notes (and respond to them)


```{r  fig.cap = '', out.width='40%', fig.asp=.4, fig.align='center',  echo = FALSE}
 knitr::include_graphics("picsfigs/hyp_anot.png")
```

\

**Sometimes, in this web-book I will specifically ask you to give answers, suggestions, and feedback on specific questions**

I will write something in a box like the one below

```{block2,  type='inputq'}

Please let me know how Hypothesis is working for you by leaving a  Hypothes.is comment HERE.

```

This means I really want you to put a comment exactly at that point in the web-book, and I'll be watching for these.



### Some more cool things about this book {-}

Look at the icons that should appear on the top of the page:

```{r  fig.cap = '', out.width='75%', fig.asp=.4, fig.align='center',  echo = FALSE}
 knitr::include_graphics("picsfigs/top_icons.png")
```

\

These allow you to:

- Hide/show the outline bar
- Search the full text for a word
- Change the font style, color, and size
- Show keyboard shortcuts



```{r  fig.cap = 'For example, you can choose nighttime serif font', out.width='95%', fig.asp=.4, fig.align='center',  echo = FALSE}
 knitr::include_graphics("picsfigs/night_font.png")
```



### Tech details of this book ('do I call this 'collophon'?) {-#collophon}

I created this in Rmd (the 'R languages' 'markdown'), including some latex and html code too, with features adapted from the 'Tufte' package.

This is all put together by  Knitr and Bookdown using the 'Pandoc' conversion tool into an Html file which I'm hosting via Github pages for now. For details on how this works, I have a guide (to how I work in a similarly constructed 'bookdown') [HERE](https://daaronr.github.io/ea_giving_barriers/bookdown-appendix.html).

I'll occasionally use/show some R code; you should consider getting proficient in R and developing other 'data-sciencey' tech skills (things like R, Python, Stata, git, vim, shell scripts...)

Let me know if you want to look 'under the hood'...

```{block2,  type='fold'}

All source material and code can be accessed [on my Github repo](https://github.com/daaronr/micro-giving-pub)

```

```

\


What you will get out of this module and your Exeter experience: interaction (unfold)


```{block2,  type='fold'}


Not to hear what I have to say/write, but to

- Ask detailed questions in your own words and get answers, suggestions and feedback, with many followups

- Show your ideas and understanding and get my feedback (and possible
recommendations/references )

- Be part of exciting discussions and problem-solving with me and with fellow students

- Work on a project to build your understanding, ability to apply concepts from the module, communication skills...  and to get feedback on your ideas ... helping you prepare for your dissertation and professional projects


Interact...

- In synchronous sessions and tutorials (and in comments on pre-record)
- On the ELE forum
- Within this web-book itself!
- In my office hours (or by appointment)
- Possible additional discussion groups and breakout rooms with your peers, which I will moderate
- Through your project and presentation (coursework), which I'll give you feedback on


```

\


3. The web book, the text book, and other resources

```{block2,  type='fold'}

Web book:

- Online, open-access
- Continually updated and adapted to your interests and ideas
- A variety of formats (text, expansions/links, math, Q\&A, data/code, video, interactive)
- You can ask questions and make comments *right in the book* using hypothes.is!!! (including with math notation)

\

ELE

- Organisational, parameters of the module
- Announcements and the 'forum'
- A variety of other tools and resources for interacting,
  - including possible collaborative wiki and note taking


\

The main textbook (mostly)

- Martin Osborne and Ariel Rubinstein: leading researchers, thinkers, and communicators in microeconomics, especially Game Theory and Behavioral Economics

- Online and open-source $\rightarrow$ at the core of a potential global conversation

- Very rigourous, formal and logical (including maths) but not too 'computational'

- Very good at explanations, examples, counter-examples, and motivation. The exercises are interesting applications in themselves!

- Considers the assumptions and the 'why carefully' ...
- not just the 'standard classical differentiable models' but 'behavioral economics' is considered throughout, and models relaxing the 'standard assumptions'

\

Other resources for interaction include...

- Hypothesis notes throughout the web
- Potential: Zoom, Teams, other 'live' tools
- Collaborative docs and wikis perhaps?

## How to do well in this module {-#success-tip}

```{block2,  type='tip'}

1. Put in the work

- Read the handout and the suggested parts of the texts/readings x (as outlined in this handout); ask questions and make sure you understand the answers


- Do the problem set questions and practice exercises, the suggested questions in the web-book. Respond to the discussion questions and get feedback.

\

2. Learn from the 'ground up': You cannot 'skip' learning steps. If you do not understand the concept *behind* the concept being explained, go back and learn it.

2. Care about the *content*: Care about *actually* understanding this stuff. This will be rewarded. Don't try to game this. It's easier and better to just learn this stuff. Try to achieve *Real Understanding*: Be able to explain this stuff in your own words (in writing) and apply it to new situations

3. Interact and discuss: Peers, Forum, office hours (see above)


4. Be careful you know how to interpret the midterm exam instructions correctly, as well as the instructions for the project. Use your time wisely.


5. For the project: start writing and outlining as you begin and as you progress -- don't wait to write things down. Be in contact with me (and your fellow students) to continually discuss how this is going.


6. *Skills to hone and build.* Your success in this module will depend in large part on building and applying maths skills and tools, as well as strong reading/writing/logic and communication abilities. You should build the ability to comprehend and respond carefully and logically to nuanced questions, in careful writing, orally, in maths, and in diagrams. Be able to incorporate quantitative reasoning, logic, and the ability to understand and clearly express ideas, to correctly characterise and describe theories and evidence, and to apply learned principles to new situations.

Some ['Fortune Cookie Wisdom'](#fortune) that may help you think about the material in this module, and Economics in general.

Although we are not focusing on 'market failure' in this module (BEEM101, 2020), there are some interesting examples I often discuss, of how these can lead to business opportunities. See this [supplement](#mkt-fail-bus)... and let me know your thoughts.

Some key questions and topics for this module (video notes below the fold):

```{block2,  type='fold'}

Key topics:

1. Preferences and choice

- Supermarket choice example; two 'decision modes'; business 'big data modeling' implications

2. Consumer demand

- Esp., how it responds to prices and income, and the implications of this.

3. Preferences and choices under (probablistic) uncertainty (building blocks for finance!)

- How do we value 'a bundle of possibilities' against another bundle ... and how do we choose among these?
  - Insurance, investments, life choices (university, job), consumer choices
  - 'Risk aversion' and the returns to risk

4. (Monopoly) firms: product offerings, pricing and segmentation

- How do they max (LR) profits in light of consumer choices?
- What are the implications of this for society?
- How can they 'do segmentation' to boost profits?
- What do they actually do? (Using data?)

5. Strategic interaction and game theory

- E.g., 'which side of the street to walk on?', 'how much to charge/produce if there is a competing firm?', 'should I ask my partner to marry me?', 'how much should a political campaign invest in advertising in a particular state/county?'


- Is there an advantage or disadvantage to 'being the first to make an offer' in bargaining?

- When should I wear a mask? What should we predict about 'who wears a mask' and what should increase or decrease this?
  - 'Other-regarding' preferences (BE) may enter here!

\

Throughout, but with supplements at the end:

- Behavioural economics
- Applications and evidence from the real world and the 'laboratory'
- Research and research skills (reading/writing, mathematical modeling, critical thinking, considering applications to the real world and to data, research integrity)

```


Note: contrast from previous years (unfold)

```{block2,  type='fold'}

The 'story of this module' (in the video and fold above) is modified from how I structured it in prior years. In contrast to the approach I'm taking now, Microeconomics is often taught in terms of:

1. 'building blocks of the market' on the consumer and producer side
2. putting this together to consider the market in 'general equilibrium' under perfect competition, and the welfare consequences of this
3. market failures and departures from perfect competition.

This year (in this web book) I'm taking a different path. We are focusing instead on the meaning, tools, and structure of decision-making and on how to consider and apply models. I will put a strong  emphasis on uncertainty, strategic interaction, and behavioral economics/psychology. There is *less* focus on welfare, market equilibrium, or the model of production.

```


## Planned syllabus, coverage (detailed) {-#coverage}


```{block2,  type='note'}

The planned module outline is below.

All timings are approximate and may need to be adjusted. Some material may be cut for time constraints.  Feel free to skip over the first time you read these notes; you may want to refer to this later. 

The relevant part of this outline will be repeated at the beginning of each section within this book. After I add the material to that section, I may remove it from this outline.


```


### Overview of module \& rules, discussion/background, [Economic models (\& maths tools), 'empirical' evidence](#intro)  ($\frac{1}{2}$ week) {-}


<div class="marginnote">
This content will take roughly half a week to cover, but we will return to it later.
</div>

- Coverage and notes: below (on the present page)
- [Models, meaning, metrics, maths revision](#intro)
- [Interactive exercises  ('problem set')](#intro-exercise)

\

### Sec. \@ref(pref-util-choice): [Preferences and utility; Choice](#pref-util-choice) (1.5 weeks) {-}

What can we reasonably say about 'what people prefer and choose'? How can we state this carefully and precisely? What are the implications of particular 'reasonable' assumptions? (How) can we consider this in terms of 'optimization'? How have Economists and decision-scientists considered these questions?

Note on mathematical precision (unfold)

```{block2,  type='fold'}

This precision is relevant for Behavioral Economics (a specialty of Ariel Rubinstein and an interest of mine).  The text involves behavioral economics throughout.
... also relevant for building empirical 'models of consumer choices and preferences' in business/consulting settings.

We approach this in an abstract and logically and mathematically-rigorous, but not highly 'computational' way. Even if you have taken Economics as an undergraduate, you may not have seen this approach.

We will not always be quite so mathematically rigorous throughout the module. However, I want to give you  a 'flavour' of this approach and, and the tools at the core of modern microeconomics (and the approach taught in PhD programmes).

```

###  Sec. \@ref(uncertainty) [Preferences under uncertainty (and over time)](#uncertainty) (1 week) {-} 

<div class="marginnote">
 
Here we follow the order of O-R in covering preferences under uncertainty *before* consumer behavior and demand. 

</div>

- 'Expected Utility'
- Risk-aversion, finance and diversification
- time-preference and discounting (briefly)

With uncertainty (outcomes are unknown when choices are made, but we assume the *probabilities* of outcomes are known), again ...

> What can we reasonably say about 'what people prefer and choose'? How can we state this carefully and precisely? What are the implications of particular 'reasonable' assumptions? (How) can we consider this in terms of 'optimization'? How have Economists and decision-scientists considered these questions?


\

Applications (esp. to finance):

- How do we express and measure 'risk aversion'?
- How does this affect (financial, investment, insurance) choices?  Why does 'diversification improve outcomes for the risk-averse'?
- How does this affect asset prices (Stocks, bonds, etc.) with 'efficient markets' (this will be briefly defined)
- Behavioral Economics: the "Allais Paradox" (first treatment, time-permitting)


\

Brief (first) presentation:

- Preferences (and optimization over) assets and consumption over time; 'discounting'

\

**Main Readings:**

*Web book*, and also...

- O-R Chapter 3: "Preferences under Uncertainty"


*Feel free to skip the following* (unfold)

```{block2,  type='fold'}

Feel free to SKIP:

... the proof of propositions 3.2 ('Continuity and independence implies EU'). It's interesting but we can't cover everything.

If you don't understand the proof of prop. 3.3. (the equivalence of risk aversion and the concavity of the Bernoulli function) that's also OK.

```

- McDL: 13.3 on 'dynamic choice'

\

**Other resources/references** (unfold)

- O-R Chapter 4, selected parts

<div class="marginnote">
Note this chapter covers only a simple 2-good example.

- Supplementary but recommended readings (see below)

#### [Interactive exercises - consumer preferences, behavior, demand ('problem set')](#ex-cons-pref)  {-}

### Noting a major "skip" {-}

**Note here that we are SKIPPING several key topics in consumer demand (unfold)**

```{block2,  type='fold'}

- In the consumer behavior, we are skipping core topics including formal definitions of Hicksian demand, substitution and income effects, and the Slutsky decomposition.


These are important for characterizing the welfare effects of price changes and policy changes (including taxation), and for conceptualizing issues involving multiple constraints on consumer optimization (e.g., rationing). I will provide notes on these for anyone who is interested.

```


\

We are also skipping most of the 'production side' (skipped material in fold)

```{block2,  type='fold'}

- Production functions, firm optimisation

- Perfect competition/competitive equilibrium; short and long run

- Supply and demand systems

- General equilibrium and it's welfare properties

- Market failures, including externalities/public goods (although these come back as examples in our Game Theory discussion)

*We this skip these chapters in the text(s). So skip O-R chapter 6 and skip any material on this in the other texts.*

 (Or read it if you want to; you might find it useful in getting an overall picture, but it's up to you.)

```

<div class="marginnote">

To the extent that these are relevant to material we cover later, I will give you the 'short version' when it comes up.

</div>

\


### ['Monopolies and pricing of profit-maximizing price-setting firms' (especially monopolies)](#monop); [price discrimination/market segmentation](#pd) (1.5 weeks) {-}

How would a firm that knows all the stuff above about consumer demand set prices in order to maximise its profit? What if it can segment its customers into different ‘markets’ with distinct demand functions? What are the consequences of all of this for profit and welfare?

Today’s businesses, consultants, data analysts, and regulators are extremely interested in these questions. This is a very practical topic. We will consider it both from the theoretical optimization point view (while always gaining insights from the maths). We will also dig into “what do firms *actually* do in setting pricing” and “how can data be used to do this better?”

\

**Main reading**

- O-R ch. 7 "Monopoly"

We will focus on the (standard) profit-maximisation goal, although their discussion of other goals is interesting.

They define consumer and producer surplus here to give a brief treatment of the deadweight loss of monopoly.

They also have a very interesting treatment of the two main types of price discrimination; 'Implicit discrimination' foreshadows asymmetric information and agency problems.

<div class="marginnote">
There are various names of each of these ... I am familiar with "second degree  = self-selection" and "third degree or 'explicit segmentation'". They call the latter 'Implicit discrimination.
</div>


\

*Alternative treatments (unfold):*

```{block2,  type='fold'}

- McDL: Ch 15 -- Monopoly
- NS: 11.2-11.4
- QMC: Appendix A.1 - Monopoly - the vanilla version
```

\
*Supplementary recommended readings (unfold):*

```{block2,  type='fold'}

- Article: [Should we help companies tailor prices to your wage packet?](https://theconversation.com/should-we-help-companies-tailor-prices-to-your-wage-packet-47719)
- With accompanying [worked examples](https://docs.google.com/document/d/16jos_PT9w1wGpyD5A8ZiWJ9HW6kaLOJH6EWc_AYWnkk/pub)

- Material from data science and industry pricing practice to be incorporated here; see "Marketing" chapter in [Business analytics with R](https://bookdown.org/jeffreytmonroe/business_analytics_with_r7/)


```

#### Interactive exercises ('problem set') (tbd; unfold for basic idea) {-}

```{block2,  type='fold'}

OR question 1, double marginalization (very relevant and interesting!)

OR question 5-7

Possible exercise involving data and 'choosing a firm's best price and segmentation'
```

<!--
- ** Imperfect competition (brief) ** (multiple firms with market power; esp Bertrand/Cournot models)
-->

### Notes: Mid-term examination, and a major "skip" {-}

**We will have a mid-term examination at this point in the module.** This examination will cover all of the material up to this point, but it will be more heavily-focused on the earlier material.

\

<div class="marginnote">
 Note that here we are largely skipping  'imperfect competition' and interactions between firms. We may come back to this briefly in our 'game theory' examples.

</div>


### [Strategic interactions: Game theory](#game_theory) (and evidence) (2 weeks) {-#game_outline}

The outcomes we care about don't only depend on what *we choose*, but on what *others' choose* (and perhaps we can also influence the latter). How should we think about choices and outcomes in such settings? What will we predict will happen in single or repeated interactions, and what will affect these outcomes?

\

- Strategic interactions
- Stating the game in 'normal' form
- Dominance, iterated dominance, Rationalisability
- Best response functions, Nash equilibrium in pure and mixed strategies

- Extensive-form games; sequential and repeated games
- Backwards induction and Subgame Perfection (subgame-perfect Nash equilibrium)
- Infinitely or indefinitely repeated games
- Games of imperfect information
- Behavioral economics: transforming material payoffs into *true* payoffs
- Evidence on play in strategic situations, including in 'experiments'

- Time-permitting: Research applications, e.g., 'Marriage markets and Tinder; Losing Face', 'Fair trade and consumer altruism'

\

Here *the web-book* is a key resource.  We will incorporate material from:

- O-R Chapters 15-16
  - *Skip* sections 15.5 (Strictly competitive games), and 15.6 (Kantian equilibrium)
  - In chapter 16, we may or may not skip the formal depiction of extensive/sequential games; this depends on our timing

\
In addition to (some) of the Game Theory material covered in O-R:

- We will also focus on 'Dominant strategies', and 'Iterated-strict-dominance'. Compared to 'Nash equilibria', these are (IMHO) more justifiable as *predictors of choices* especially in one-shot games.
- We will consider games involving asymmetric information, especially 'signaling games'

\

*Alternative resources (unfold):*

```{block2,  type='fold'}

- QMC: Ch 9, 10, 12 (includes 'iterated dominance')
- McDL: Ch 16
- NS: Ch 5 (parts)
- Several additional concepts from handout, plus supplement on experiments

```
\

*Supplementary recommended readings (unfold):*

```{block2,  type='fold'}


- Spence, M. (1973): 'Job market signaling,' The Quarterly Journal of Economics, vol. 87, pp. 355-374. A fairly readable and extremely influential (theory) paper, extending this to games of incomplete (asymmetric) information 

- 'Ten Little Treasures of Game Theory and Ten Intuitive Contradictions' Goeree and Holt, 2001


\

*Considering experimental evidence:* 
  
- Skim or read the introduction of any of the 'Handbooks' like 'Handbook of Experimental Economics'

Meta-analysis papers like:

- Oosterbeek, Hessel, Randolph Sloof, and Gijs Van De Kuilen. "Cultural differences in ultimatum game experiments: Evidence from a meta-analysis." Experimental economics 7.2 (2004): 171-188 or

- Johnson, Noel D., and Alexandra A. Mislin. "Trust games: A meta-analysis." Journal of Economic Psychology 32.5 (2011): 865-889.


I also advise looking at recent 'replication' and 'many labs' project work; there are now more systematic attempts to get robust evidence on which patterns and effects are 'real' and which were a 'lucky draw' or 'publication bias'.  This also applies to our later discussion of behavioral economics.

\



```

\

### [Project, discussion of research](project) (1 week) {#proj-outline}

BEEM101: The majority of your mark for this module will be based on a project that you will do, and on your presentation of this project to me.


<!--  (I will also consider an empirical project if you can strongly connect it to the material taught in this module.) -->

For this project you will construct, evaluate and discuss one or more mathematical models dealing with a specific applied or theoretical economics research question. Ideally, this will be related to the work you intend to pursue for your MSc dissertation. You will be required to present and discuss this work in a short live session (10-15 minutes).

This project can be an individual project or done in a group of 2-3 people. If it is done as a group, each student will *also* be asked to present a single page outlining their own contribution to the project, and each will be required to present their work to me individually.

Further details and parameters will be given. In the final half week, we will discuss our projects.

# Models, maths, fundamentals {#intro}

This, combined with the above outline represents approximately half a week of material

## Key goals of this chunk: {-#intro-coverage}


Get a sense of, and be able to explain:


1. What Microeconomics is about and why it is useful
2. What the point of 'models' are
3. Some *applications* of these models
4. Some examples of microeconomic models and questions (should be largely revision)
    - Get your econ brain flowing
5. Discuss maths revision: know which maths you need to revise (if any)
6. Discuss 'empirical work' in Microeconomics, and how it connects to 'theory'


**Main reading for this chunk:** this web book

\
Readings on 'what is Economics', 'what are the purpose of Economic models', etc.: The readings below are each optional, but you must read at least some of these*

Unfold to see these...

<div class="marginnote">
We will return to the issues of 'what and why models' throughout the module.
</div>

```

## Empirics, maths revision

<div class="marginnote">
Some of the maths you need will also be simultaneously covered in your Optimisation and Econometric modules, sometimes at a higher level.
</div>

We will use some maths in this module, and now would be a good time to revise some of this on your own.

Here are some key elements.

<!-- #TODO: link some revision material -->

1.  We will consider the use of microeconomics in **'empirical identification'** of effects using data.  [The mixtape, Scott Cunningham](http://scunning.com/cunningham_mixtape.pdf) pp 18-22, provides a good introduction to this

2.  So called 'pre-calculus' and general maths concepts including
- The symbolic language and notation of maths, summation and product operators
- Multivariate and univariate functions (and mappings), inverses of functions, implicit functions
  - Plotting these functions over their domain and range; the 'level sets' of multivariate functions
  - Specific functions including: Logarithms/exponential functions, quadratic and higher-order polynomial functions, 'min' and 'max' operators
- Limits, Geometric series


3. Some elements of basic calculus, including, perhaps

<div class="marginnote">
However, in general I'm not asking you to memorize sets of rules; I'll give hints to remind you of these rules on any examination.
</div>

```{block2,  type='tip'}

Some very simple math revision [HERE](https://recapexeter.cloud.panopto.eu/Panopto/Pages/Embed.aspx?id=e0866970-34e1-4aa5-8385-8c1ef8d75b1c&autoplay=false&offerviewer=true&showtitle=true&showbrand=false&start=0&interactivity=all), from my prior lecture. However, you will find better coverage of this at Khan Academy (free) and elsewhere.

```  

- Derivatives and their interpretations
  - As 'slopes'
  - Higher-order derivatives and cross-partials, relevance for 'minima and maxima' (optimization)
- Integrals and their interpretation
- 'Total differentiation' of a function
- Constrained optimization and (perhaps) the Lagrangian method (probably optional)
- The implicit function theorem (probably optional) and 'comparative statics'

What sort of models are we talking about?...

<div class="marginnote">
To refresh your memory... you have probably seen some of these models before in your previous economics module. You should have some familiarity with the simple models of supply and demand curves yielding an equilibrium price and quantity. You may also have seen a models of trade, between two countries or two individuals, with only two goods, where for each good one has a 'comparative advantage'. Other models involve 'strategic' interactions bwtween a few 'players'. Others involve individual 'optimizing' choices. Still others involve firms and governments setting 'mechanisms' trying to induce particular choices by others.
</div>


Consider: Are they ‘fully realistic’? No. They are models, i.e., simplifications.

A huge body of work has gone into making these models more complex and ‘general'; some of the conclusions are preserved, others are weakened or reversed. But even these more general models are simplifications.

<div class="marginnote">
But I don't find it satisfactory if people respond to a meaningful criticism of a model and the way it is being applied with 'it's just a model, and all models are abstractions.' Specific critiques need to be dealt with directly.
</div>


### So why learn these models, if they are not realistic?

Consider the parable of the tortoise and the hare (Aesop)...

- [Original version, English translation](http://read.gov/aesop/025.html)
- [Merrie Melodies version](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LthoQPO6YLE)

\

```{r  fig.cap = '', out.width='55%', fig.asp=.4, fig.align='center',  echo = FALSE}
 knitr::include_graphics(file.path("picsfigs","tortoisehare.jpg"))
```



One might question the realism of this story:

- Can hares really speak?
- Is this a rabbit or a hare?
- What other animals were racing?


Okay, the story is not so realistic. However, it conveys an important message. Is this message in any way affected by the answers to the above questions?

The same can be asked about many criticisms of simple economic models. Of course one should always consider the applicability of particular models to real-world problems, and carefully consider whether the assumptions are reasonable and relevant, and whether the departures from these assumptions will lead to any different predictions. However, in considering the general insight conveyed by the model, some criticisms can merely be distracting. At the very least, we should not reject economic models simply because they are not fully realistic, just as we do not reject Aesop's fables because they involve talking animals. The idea of 'Ceteris paribus' (all other things being equal) can help us here.

\

**Again, so why learn these models?**

- They are a starting point
- They (sometimes) make concrete predictions you can test
- They may be useful for building insight, clear arguments, a way of thinking


- Discussion is framed around these models and they are seen as a 'baseline'
- You must understand the arguments and models to be able to effectively critique or extend them

<div class="marginnote">
For example, some critics of what they call 'neoliberal economics' can be misinformed about what it is. Their criticism can sound to us mainstream economists like someone who says 'cars are dangerous and should be banned because they go too fast and have no mechanism for stopping'.
</div>

## Economic Models {#econ-models}


See audio/slides, from 101:25 - [HERE](https://recapexeter.cloud.panopto.eu/Panopto/Pages/Viewer.aspx?id=9B44DE1E-2569-4076-9D7B-AACC0064717D#)

**Economic model:**

One definition:

> A simple theoretical description that captures the essentials of how the economy works.

<div class="marginnote">
For the material we cover in this module, this definition would only work if we interpret the term 'economy' very broadly.
</div>

\


**What is economic theory and what can it do?**

Unlike “theory” in some other social science disciplines, economic theory is mostly based on mathematical modelling and rigorous proof that certain conclusions or results can be derived from certain assumptions. But theory alone can say little about the real world.



<div class="marginnote">
For example, my impression is that in Psychology a 'theory' can represent broad descriptions and stories summarizing and providing a framework for understanding empirical evidence.
</div>


In Economic theory we can prove theorems, essentially the logic of 'if-then' statements... 'if one assumes the following preferences, the following choice is optimising', etc. However, here the realism of the *assumptions* is always in question; as caricatured in this [Twitter 'meme'](https://twitter.com/rethinkecon/status/1164477365243785216/photo/1).


```{block2,  type='note'}

In Economics: Models = Theory = Uses Mathematics... for the most part.

```

Again, 'economic theory' and models generally do not provide evidence about the real world, they just tell us things like

> if (i) people make choices exactly as specified by assumption *X*, (ii) their choices will be the same as if they made these according to assumption *Y*, (iii) and the outcomes will have the following relationship (e.g., quantity demanded sloping downward in prices), and vice-versa.

But this doesn't tell us that people *do* make choices as specified by assumption *X*. We are simply showing the mathematical equivalence of (i), (ii), and (iii).

<div class="marginnote">

I discuss this further:
- in my 'writing book' [here](https://daaronr.github.io/writing_econ_research/theory-modeling-empirical.html) and
- [here](https://daaronr.github.io/writing_econ_research/methods-fields.html)

</div>



### Differing views about models

There are **differing views** on the meaning, purpose, and use of economic models.

```{block2,  type='note'}

This discussion is rather abstract but important. These concerns and issues may make more sense as we get into considering specific models in detail. So we will try to come back to this.

```

<div class="marginnote">
We will return to this in our discussions, and again when we consider the use of experiments. See the suggested  readings/notes on readings.
</div>

```{block2,  type='note'}


**Source reading**: The discussion below is largely from [@Sugden2017] ["Credible worlds: the status of theoretical models in economics." Journal of Economic Methodology  (2010)](https://www.jstor.org/stable/40267405?seq=1)


Sugden's paper mentions two famous papers, one of which is (Nobel Laureate George) Akerlof's "the Market for Lemons" [@Akerlof1970]. It would be worth reading some of Akerlof's paper and seeing how much you can follow; it is rather accessible. We may return to this specific model of asymmetric information later in the module, and it could certainly be relevant for your project.


If you are interested, I will set up a wiki to engage in a group discussion of these articles.

```

\

The  *instrumentalist* view:


The Methodology of Positive Economics [@friedmanMethodologyPositiveEconomics1953]: the ultimate goal of theory is to "yield valid and meaningful ... predictions about phenomena not yet observed."


- “Simplicity” -- ‘the less initial knowledge needed to make a prediction'.

- “Fruitful” -- more precise predictions, for a wider range of situations


\


In contrast, the *'Fictionalist'* view  [@Sugden2017]:

> describes a fictional world that is credible or truthlike in something like the way that the events of a realistic novel are; the model connects with the real world by relations of similarity

\

*Some considerations:*

Are these models predictive? If not, are they useful?  

- There are arguments for modeling optimising behavior even if it is *not* predictive.  


- There is some evidence for near-optimisation in some settings, and that choices move in this direction.

- There is also evidence of 'predictable irrationality' (or 'bounded rationality); this motivates behavioural economics.  There is also some evidence for the following (unfold).

```{block2,  type='fold'}


1. Psychological costs/benefits relating to *outcomes other than their own final consumption*. People may care about

- others' consumption (altruism etc.),
- about the way they *make* the decision
- ... and about how close they come to certain goals (see 'reference points' and 'loss aversion').

2. People have self-control problems.  They also may realize their short-term choices are not in their lt interest, and try to constrain themselves.

2. It is mentally costly to carefully calculate the costs and benefits $\rightarrow$  'rational inattention'

- As a result, people may follow simple rules or 'heuristics' to make their decisions easier; e.g., 'work every day until I've earned  target income'.

```


### The PPF: a 'model' and a way of seeing things

```{block2,  type='note'}

At this point we consider a simple and specific model to fix ideas, to make things less abstract. The NS text brings up the production possibility frontier; this is a common example to start with, although by itself it could be argued that 'the insights gained are basically by assumption' ... there is not really an additional reasoning step. Perhaps a better depiction of this example is in [the Curtis and Irvine open access text](https://open.umn.edu/opentextbooks/textbooks/microeconomics-markets-methods-and-models), sections 1.3-1.5, where they consider two individuals with distinct production possibilities, and derive the 'aggregate' ppf, and show the gains to trade.

```

```{r  fig.cap = 'Production possibility frontier', out.height='75%', fig.asp=.4, fig.align='center',  echo = FALSE}
 knitr::include_graphics(file.path("picsfigs", "ppf_cc.png"))
```

<div class="marginnote">
PPF file source [LINK](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Production_Possibilities_Frontier_Curve.svg), User:Everlong, CC-BY-SA-3.0)
</div>

Above, we see a depiction of the "production possibility frontier". You may be familiar with this from your previous study. The PPF describes the maximum amount of one good that can be produced conditional on a certain quality of another good being produced.

According to  [@nicholsonIntermediateMicroeconomicsIts2007]

The PPF illustrates key principles:

1. Scarce Resources

2. Scarcity involves opportunity cost.

<div class="marginnote">
- The opportunity cost of a good is measured by the alternative uses that are foregone producing it.
- On the PPF above the opportunity cost of more guns is less butter.
- The opportunity cost of a choice is the foregone 'next best' opportunity from a choice.
- I may just call this ‘cost’
</div>

```{block2,  type='inputq'}

Can you think of an example that illustrates the distinction between what is commonly thought of as the  'cost' and the economists' definition of an 'opportunity cost'?

```


3.  Opportunity costs are (often) increasing.

-  What this means is that as you produce more of one good, its opportunity cost (in terms of the other good foregone) increases.

- The “law” of diminishing marginal returns.

<div class="marginnote">
I'm somewhat sceptical of this being a 'law'; there are certainly increasing returns in certain regions. However, you will see it again and again as it is a fairly standard assumption.
</div>

<br>

**However**

I'm not sure if I would call this a 'model'. It certainly provides a way of visualizing the trade-offs in an economy, and the way it is drawn embody certain assumptions.

<div class="marginnote">
This graphic has a mathematical representation which we will not cover now.
</div>

Consider: How could we make this a meaningful 'model with assumptions'?  *I could imagine it as below (unfold).*


```{block2,  type='fold'}

To make this more clearly a 'model with assumptions', let's assume an economy with

1. Two possible goods: food and clothing
2. A single input into the production process for either good labour (L)
3. The economy has a fixed supply of labour $\bar{L}$.
4. The production function for food is $F_f(L)$ and the production function for clothing is $F_c(L)$, with both 'strictly and continuously increasing in their argument'. All firms have these same production functions (this implies there are no spillovers/externalities between firms, and no complementarities between producing each good)

5. Both production functions exhibit diminishing returns to scale (we leave off the maths for how to precisely define this for now)

```


These assumptions in the fold above could be considered a 'model' of an economy. Note that not everything has been specified. E.g., we might ask: i.  How many firms are there? ii. How do the firms compete in output and input markets? iii. What exactly are these production functions?  There are also clearly unrealistic elements, e.g.: i. Only two goods, ii.  Only one input, iii.  No complementarities in production

Still, the assumptions given will yield a PPF with the shape above: the 'feasible production set' of the economy will have a particular shape. It's 'maximal elements' constitute the 'frontier' of this set, which will be:

- downward-sloping, because each unit of the input ($L$) used to produce clothing cannot be used to produce food, and

- concave (increasing opportunity costs), because of the diminishing returns to scale for each good ... as more labour is diverted to clothing away from food, it becomes less and less relatively productive.

This seems to convey an insight that 1. teaches us a way of thinking and 2. seems likely to carry over into more 'realistic' models. At the very least, it suggests that, under any economic system, there *may* be tradeoffs between how much of each good or service can be consumed. E.g., policymakers may need to consider 'should we have more health care or more non-health consumption', rather than simply saying 'we should provide the best health care that money can buy to everyone.'

<div class="marginnote">
One might at this point raise the 'paradox of analysis': we have stated a set of 'assumptions' and then noted what logically follows. But actually, the 'results' and the assumptions are basically logically equivalent. So have we simply defined the answer we wanted to get, i.e., circular reasoning? This is a deeply philosophical issue.
</div>

The '*increasing* opportunity costs' insight seems more fragile, more dependent on a fairly strong assumption. How do we know that there are diminishing returns to scale for each good? There are plausible reasons why it may be the opposite... returns to specialisation as an economy, etc.

Furthermore, the model at *this* level of simplicity cannot speak to a number of questions. E.g., without a sense of the market structure (how many firms and how do they compete), we do not know whether we will *attain* the PPF-- the economy may end up producing at the inferior point 'C', for example.

A 'simpler' model is not necessarily better, nor necessarily worse.

<div class="marginnote">
For comprehension: *Be sure you can draw the PPF; consider its slope and what it means*
</div>

### "Supply and demand functions", the "Marshallian cross", "equilibrium effects" {-}

Perhaps the most famous model from micro-economics is what is often called 'supply and demand', the 'Marshallian cross'.

<div class="marginnote">

I try to avoid the terms 'supply' or 'demand' because it confuses whether we are referring to:

1. Supply curves and demand curves (or functions) *or*
2. *Quantities* exchanged (in equilibrium quantity demanded will equal quantity supplied in each market.

</div>

Is this helpful in explaining the real world?

Does it make better predictions than other approaches might do in terms of... (for example)?

- The impact of taxes on prices and quantities exchanged?
- The response of oil prices to events like the Coronavirus pandemic?
- Whether a tradesperson would find it profitable to increase his or her price when she seems to be getting more orders than she can handle?


<div class="marginnote">
Of course the simple model predicts that she should raise her prices in this situation... so there should never be a 'shortage' unless prices are restrained. However, when I tried to hire a plumber in Exeter in 2017 I was repeatedly told 'everyone is too busy', not 'rates are very high these days'. What could explain this?
</div>



\

### Models applied in the context of "returns to university education" {-}

We may ask a question something like:

> Is it worth the cost and time for the typical US high-school student to enroll in university ('college')?


In the US private university tuitions run at over £40,000 per year (for a four-year course!) There is constant popular (and academic) discussion of this. See some links below the fold.


```{block2,  type='fold'}
- [Please stop asking whether college is worth it](https://www.forbes.com/sites/dereknewton/2018/12/16/please-stop-asking-whether-college-is-worth-it/)


- [Is your university degree barely worth the paper it’s written on? Discuss](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/mar/16/university-degree-measure-benefits-tuition-fees)


- [The case against education, Bryan Caplan; LSE review](https://blogs.lse.ac.uk/lsereviewofbooks/2018/05/30/book-review-the-case-against-education-why-the-education-system-is-a-waste-of-time-and-money-by-bryan-caplan/)

\

*Note: the above are popular accounts, not academic Economic peer-reviewed publications.*

For some fairly recent academic references, see (e.g.) [@Carneiro2011], papers cited wihin this, and papers citing it.  [Link to paper](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4126808/)

```


*Consider:*

1. How would you frame the above question, as an economist, in terms of things that can be defined and measured?

\

2. What does the answer to the question depend on, from an economics perspective?


This involves microeconomic concepts such as (unfold)


```{block2,  type='fold'}

- Returns to labour inputs in (competitive?) markets; human capital

- The role of skilled labor in the production function

- Asymmetric information over employee 'type' and 'signaling'

- Intertemporal substitution of consumption and 'discount rates'

Even framing the question requires microeconomics.

Consider: Social vs private returns. Is there a case for 'market failure' in the provision of education?

```

\


3. How would you measure this *empirically*? (some thoughts in the fold)


```{block2,  type='fold'}

Empirical 'identification' is very difficult. Suppose you simply compared the incomes of those who did and didn't go to university. These is a well known 'endogeneity' or 'omitted variable bias' problem here. It seems reasonable to think:

"...compared to those who did not go to university, those who went to university would have tended to earn more (and perhaps to be more socially productive) *even if they had not gone to university*."  So how can we identify the actual *effect* of university on their outcomes.

We have a set of other approaches that arguably allow us to answer this 'causal question'... see further discussions on 'causal inference', causal econometrics, and in 'empirical labor economics'.

These approaches generally involve either:

1. Very careful 'control strategies' to try to compare observably similar people who did or did not attend university *or*

1. Something approximately equivalent to a 'natural experiment' ('instrumental variables', lottery assignments, 'regression discontinuities', etc.)


```

\


### How to evaluate, asses, and test models? {-}

Unsurprisingly, there are a variety of opinions as to how to asses the value of a model. Some considerations include their 'elegance' (which is a bit vague), their 'insightfulness', 'how many predictions are generated from the fewest assumptions', the 'simplicity' of the model, and other somewhat-difficult to asses concerns.

As models are simplifications, it is not always clear what it would mean to 'test their validity' in terms of the real world.


We might consider two broad approaches:

1. Testing Assumptions: Examining the validity of *assumptions* upon which models are based. (Is it reasonable to assume that people are rational, that firms maximize profits etc.?)

2. Testing Predictions (of the models): Can the model accurately *predict* real-world events (in the context which it purports to?)  If the model predicts events well, then the theory is useful even if the assumption may not appear to be valid.

<div class="marginnote">
DR: But if the assumptions are substantially wrong, it may predict well in one particular case but not in general.
</div>
 

\

Consider: Should we ever 'test assumptions'? (Unfold)

```{block2,  type='fold'}

Some authors (e.g., the undergraduate textbook [@nicholsonIntermediateMicroeconomicsIts2007]) are somewhat dismissive of the idea of testing assumptions.  

However, there are many cases in which the *predictions* of the models are very hard to test; e.g., the impact of a radical change in government policy or the merger of the two largest firms.  On the other hand, in many cases the key assumptions entering into models, such as 'constant relative risk aversion' or 'geometric discounting' can be very credibly tested.  We can use existing micro data on thousands of household decisions, as well as experiments, to measure 'how close' behavior is to the assumption.

```

\


There is also substantial debate over what it means, and whether/when it is valuable to 'test an Economic model in the laboratory'.  See the discussion by [Sugden and Sitzia, 2011; "Implementing theoretical models in the laboratory, and what this can and cannot achieve."](https://ueaeco.github.io/working-papers/papers/cbess/UEA-CBESS-11-08.pdf)


## Aside: Empirical work/econometrics

I want you to have a sense of what this is, and how it connects to economic theory. This is relevant background for the present module, and extremely important for your later research/dissertation work (and it may give some perspective for other modules like Econometrics). I give a supplement on this which I highly recommend reading in supplement \@ref(empir-research) ['Empirical research'](#empir-research).


# Models: Interactive exercises  ('problem set'): {-#intro-exercise}

```{block2,  type='note'}

**Exercise:**

Form groups of 4-5 students. Arrange to meet (online or in person but safely socially distanced) to follow-up on this.

**Each student should:**

1. Identify a specific 'Microeconomic model' other than those discussed above. (Alternately, you can microeconomic framework or technique such as 'Rationalizability'; however, it should be a formal model expressed in maths of some form.). Characterise this in simple terms, if possible. 

2. Find an *academic economics* peer-reviewed paper in which this model is used, adapted, or discussed. Explain how it is used. (It might be used to make policy recommendations, to guide empirical work, or to aid our understanding of individual choices, interactions, and market outcomes.)

3. Identify the *assumptions* of this model. Do they seem reasonable?

4. What *predictions* does this model make (if any)? Do these seem reasonable?

5. Explain the strengths and limitations of this model, and the way it is used.

# Preferences, Utility and Choice {#pref-util-choice}

What can we reasonably say about 'what people prefer and choose'? How can we state this carefully and precisely? What are the implications of particular 'reasonable' assumptions? (How) can we consider this in terms of 'optimization'? How have Economists and decision-scientists considered these questions?


```{block2,  type='note'}

Digging deeply into the logic and justifications for these models of choice, and alternative frameworks, will be very relevant in considering Behavioral Economics (This is a specialty of Ariel Rubinstein, one of the O-R text's two authors, and also a research interest of mine). In fact, this text works behavioral economics in from the beginning.

This is also relevant for building empirical models such as 'models of consumer choices and preferences' in ways that are relevant to (e.g.) business-data-analytics consulting.

```


<!-- This will take at least two weeks to cover meaningfully. -->



```{block2,  type='note'}

We approach this in an abstract and logically and mathematically-rigorous, but not highly 'computational' way. Even if you have taken Economics as an undergraduate, you may not have seen this approach.

We will not always be quite so mathematically rigorous throughout the module. However, I want to at least give you some of these tools, and a 'flavour' of this approach, which characterises modern Microeconomics (and will be at the core of PhD modules).
```

## Key goals of this chunk

1. Understand ways preferences are formally modeled. Learn this notation and be able to construct and use these models
2. Consider the meaning and reasonableness of distinct assumptions over preferences
3. Gain some sense of the implications of these models and assumptions for deep questions of human behavior, as well as  practical applied questions
4. Learn how to construct and understand simple mathematical proofs involving preference relations


## Reading {#reading-prefs}

### Interactive exercises ('problem set') {#pref-exc}

### Content

```{block2,  type='note'}

This section will go through the relevant O-R text material and a bit more. However, you should read the relevant sections of O-R alongside this.

```


## Preferences {#preferences}


```{block2,  type='note'}

Note that this excerpts and mainly follows O-R chapter 1. I try to highlight the key points, explain them a bit more, and add some additional content that seems important. You must read that chapter (except for the sections I note you may skip) *along with* these notes. All quotes are from O-R unles otherwise noted.

```

```{block2,  type='warning'}

This section considers preferences *separately* from choices. Later, we will consider choices as potentially being made according to one's preferences subject to one's constraints.

However, behavioral economics also considers the possibility (and ways in which) individual might make *choices* that in fact to not optimise, even given their own preferences. 

```  


### Preamble


<div class="marginnote">
We now consider the very very fundamental building blocks behind the (in)famous 'neoclassical economics model.' If you accept these 'axioms' nearly everything flows from it! We will also consider alternative assumptions influenced by  behavioral economics.
</div>

### A 'motivating' exercise

<div class="marginnote">
Please feel free to type some thoughts in the Hypothes.is sidebar, to engage discussion on this.

You can find another 'idea-stimulating' exercise referenced in the O-R book, the questionnaire they give at [http://gametheory.tau.ac.il/exp11/](http://gametheory.tau.ac.il/exp11/). It's worth doing as they refer to it later in several parts of the book.

</div>



**Consider...**

</center>


```{block2,  type='inputq'}

Consider a decision you recently made?  Define this decision clearly; what were the options?  How do you think you decided among these options?

What did this depend on? Would other people in your place have made the same decision?

If you got amnesia and forgot what you decided and then were in the same situation again. Do you think you'd make the same decision?

```


\

<center>

```{r  fig.cap = 'Am I blowing your mind here?', out.width='50%', fig.asp=.4, fig.align='center',  echo = FALSE}
 knitr::include_graphics("picsfigs/mortys-mind-blower.png")
```

</center>

\

```{block2,  type='inputq'}
Next, suppose I asked you:   'State a rule that governs how people *do* make decisions'...

I want this rule to be both

1. Informative (it rules *out* at least some sets of choices) and

2. Predictive (people rarely if ever violate this rule).

```
\



Now suppose I asked an apparently similar question:

```{block2,  type='inputq'}

'State a rule that governs how people *should* make decisions'..


By 'should' I mean that *they will not regret having made decisions in this way.*


If people *did* follow these rules, what would this imply and predict?

```

\

Economists (and decision theorists/decision scientists) have specifically defined such rules in terms of 'axioms about preferences'

They have started from these 'reasonable axioms' and followed their logical implications for individual choices, individual responses to changes in prices and income, market prices and quantities and their responses, 'welfare' and inequality outcomes for entire economies, etc.

The 'Standard axioms' (imply that) choices can be expressed by 'individuals maximising *utility functions* subject to their *budget constraints*'.

This yields predictions for individual behavior, markets, etc. We will get to this.


```{block2,  type='note'}

We want to develop a model that can be used to show how we make choices or decisions.

In the (neo) classical economics framework, your (optimising) choices are determined by two things:

1. Preferences: what goods do you like?

2. Constraints: how much money do you have, what are the prices of the goods you buy?

```

\

`r format_with_col("Some more thoughts on 'why are we learning this strange stuff?' (unfold)", "green")`


```{block2,  type='fold'}

For the classical Economics model, the work on preferences seems (to me) mainly as largely a matter of 'finding a consistent justification for our models of utility and choice'. If you already find these models plausible, perhaps this is not so interesting.

However, I see these details as particularly relevant for a few reasons and in a few contexts.
  
**When we take a step back and look outside the classical model to consider:** 

**1. Group and 'social preferences'** including preferences over abstract quantities and contexts that nonetheless have real impact on decisions. For example, 'effective altruists' and social planners need to consider whether to support charities and policies that may 'bring more happy people into existence' against others that do more to 'improve the happiness of existing people'. The philosophical issue of "population ethics" (see., e.g., @blackorbyIntertemporalPopulationEthics1995, and the discussion in [this podcast](https://80000hours.org/podcast/episodes/hilary-greaves-global-priorities-institute/#transcript)) delves deeply into how preferences can be reasonably defined. ... and millions of dollars in donations are potentially at stake.

\

**2. 'Behavioral economics'** models that consider choices (and perhaps preferences) that are inconsistent in certain ways, and potential affected by 'frames'.

\

**3. Empirical approaches to modeling choices**, including some models such as 'tree-models', which may not be easily connected to the standard 'utility-maximizing' approach. 

\

**Also, this formality sharpens your mind**, and makes you better at logical argumentation in your research work, and perhaps also in things like computer programming

### Preferences: Notation, definition, explanation {#pref-def}

</center>


O-R give some background

> We follow the approach of almost all economic theory and characterize an individual by her preferences among the alternatives, without considering the origin of these preferences. 


<div class="marginnote">
And unlike many other texts, O-R *explain* that they are doing this, and, in the examples, give some indication of *why* this is relevant.
</div>


\

What sort of 'preferences' are we considering? Just 'ordinal' ones, at least for now:

> When we express preferences, we make statements like “I prefer a to b”, “I like a much better than b”, ...

> In this book [as is standard]  the model of preferences captures only statements of the first type... [the *ranking*]


\

> We can think of an individual’s preferences over a set of alternatives as encoding the answers to a questionnaire. For every pair $(x, y)$ of alternatives in the set,  the questionnaire asks the individual which of the following three statements fits best his attitude to the alternatives.

> 1. I prefer x to y.

> 2. I prefer y to x.

> 3. I regard x and y as equally desirable.

<div class="marginnote">
These will later be formally encoded as

1. $x \succ y$,

2. $y \succ x$ (or $x \prec y$),

and

3.  $x \sim y$, or equivalently, $y \sim x$ (formally: because 'equivalence operators are reflexive'),

... respectively. However, as O-R show, these can all in fact be denoted with the careful use of a single 'at least as good' operator.

</div>



\

O-R next discuss 'binary relations' and their properties.


> A binary relation on a set $X$ specifies, for each ordered pair $(x , y )$ of members of X , whether or not x relates to y in a certain way.



***

```{block2,  type='tip'}

This is getting abstract, and unless you've taken some 'pure maths' you may be a bit confused and overwhelmed here. In this case, I will try to help you: the folded content below is a question and answer on this with a student. Beware that this is a digression, so if you already know this stuff, you can skip it.

```


```{block2,  type='fold'}

**Q (from student whom I will call 'Sue'): Not sure the meaning of ‘binary relation’. Does it refer to relationships between two objects?**

**A: Yes, this is a pure maths concept.** Think of a 'binary relation' as a computer program that does the following...

1. You enter two objects (say 'peanut butter' and 'jelly')
2. It tells you 'yes, these objects are related' or 'no, they are not related'.

For example, we can apply the binary relationship '$R_s$: objects  go well together in a sandwich' to the above...

'Peanut butter' $R_s$ 'Jelly' $\rightarrow$ `true`

'Peanut butter' $R_s$ 'tuna fish' $\rightarrow$ `false`

\


Another binary relation could be '$R_l$: 'the first object is usually larger than the second one.'  Here we would have:

'Whale' $R_s$ 'Minnow' $\rightarrow$ `true`

'Minnow' $R_s$ 'Whale' $\rightarrow$ `false`


*Sue: Thank you! These examples are great!! I think they would be great to put in the web-book if you are planning to create one.*


<br>

>  For example, “acquaintance” is a binary relation on a set of people. For some pairs $(x , y )$ of people, the statement “x is acquainted with y ” is true, and for some pairs it is false.

(The English word 'acquaintance'  basically means 'has met' or 'knows').

```

\

Continuing with these questions and answers ... (unfold)

```{block2,  type='fold'}

**Q: What does the ‘acquaintance’ example mean?**

**A: To give more specific examples,** we could have, for $R_a$: 'is aquainted with':

\

The following claims seem reasonable for the real world: 
  
Sue $R_a$ "Sue's lecturer in the UK" $\rightarrow$ `true`

Sue $R_a$ "Sue's mother" $\rightarrow$ `true`

"Sue's mother" $R_a$ "Sue" $\rightarrow$ `true` (perhaps the acquaintance relationship is 'reflexive')

"Sue's mother" $R_a$ "Sue's lecturer in the UK" $\rightarrow$ `false`.

If so, this demonstrate that the real-world relationship 'is aquainted with' is not 'transitive'.


*Sue: I was not sure what 'aquaintance' meant in this example. Now I do understand!*

```

\

Another example of a binary relation (unfold Q&A)...


```{block2,  type='fold'}

> Another example of a binary relation is “smaller than” on the set of numbers. For some pairs $(x,y )$ of numbers, x is smaller than y, and for some it is not.

>  For a binary relation R, the expression $x R y$ means that x is related to y according to R. For any pair $(x, y)$ of members of X , the statement $x R y$ either holds or does not hold. For example, for the binary relation < on the set of numbers, we have $3 < 5$, but not $7<1$.

<br>

**Q: Given that R stands for relation, what does $xRy$ means? Does it mean the relationship between x and y?**

**A: It means 'x relates to y, by the relation R'.** If the relation R is 'greater than', then $xRy$ means '$x$ is greater than $y$'.

\

**Q: If so, what does yRx mean?**

**A: It means 'y relates to x' .... with the above example it means 'y is greater than x'.**

Sue: Aha!! I see.

```

***




O-R begin with the formal definition of 'at least as desirable as' (or 'seen as at least as good as'). In other words, 

"x is at least as desirable as y" is  denoted $x \succsim y$ 

> if the individual’s answer to the question regarding x and y is either “I prefer x to y” or “I regard x and y as equally desirable”. 


O-R show, that in fact, *all* of the preference relationships can be denoted with the careful use of the $\succsim$ operator. For example:

'Indifference': 

$$x \sim y \text{ if both } x \succsim y \text{ and } y \succsim x$$


and

'Strict preference' 


$$x \succ y \text{ if } x \succsim y \text{ but not } y \succsim x$$. 


<div class="marginnote">
Why? In pure maths, and perhaps in economic theory, they value stating a concept with the fewest and most 'primal' definitions possible. 

Technical note: This can help in proving properties of these objects and systems. By characterising something as the simplest mathematical object possible, we can apply all of the properties of that mathematical object that have been proven over the centuries.
</div>


```{block2,  type='inputq'}

Exercise: to be sure you understand these things, close your book/computer and try to reconstruct the construction of strict preferences or indifference from only the $\succsim$ operator. Can you give the intuition for this, explaining it clearly?

```  


\

Consider the 'Venn diagram' of preferences over x and y from the O-R text (O-R, page 5, fig. 1.1)

<div class="marginnote">
Note: Osborne and Rubinstein have requested that we not reprint any figures directly from their book.
</div>

<!--
<center> 
```{r  fig.cap = 'Venn diagram of possible preference relationships (from O-R)', out.width='900%', fig.asp=.7, fig.align='center',  echo = FALSE}
 knitr::include_graphics("picsfigs/pref-venn-or.png")
```
</center>
-->

Note that the set of preferences where 'x and y are equally desirable' is included in both the set 'x is at least as desirable as y' and the set 'y is at least as desirable as x'.


###  *Properties* of preferences (some standard assumptions; aka 'axioms')  {#pref-prop}

We consider some standard assumptions over preferences that, combined with some other assumptions,  will be  sufficient to justify using a 'utility function'. 


<div class="marginnote">

Other common assumptions (which we will return to when we consider [consumer preferences](#consumers_dmd): 

- 'More is Better' ('nonsatiation' or 'monotonicity') type of assumptions.

- ['Convex preferences,'](#convexity) 'diminishing marginal rates of substitution' or, in multiple dimensions, 'strict quasi-concavity', something you may come across in your maths/optimization module.

In general, axioms like these also stand directly behind 'revealed preference' methods for measuring how much people value nonmarket goods, like clean air and national parks.

\

#### Completeness {-}


Completeness (informal definition): "Given two options, A and B, a person can state which option they prefer or whether they find both options equally attractive."

The following is `r format_with_col("forbidden","red")`: "I cannot choose between a ski holiday and a beach holiday, yet I am not indifferent between these."

```{r  fig.cap = '', out.width='50%', fig.asp=.4, fig.align='center',  echo = FALSE}

```

\

"Why *wouldn't* I be able to express a preference? (Consider this for a moment, and then unfold...)

```{block2,  type='fold'}

In the case above it seems strange to not be able to express a preference. But for other cases it may be extremely difficult or painful to compare two things. Imagine if you were asked to compare 'between 'never seeing your mother' or 'never seeing your father.' 

<div class="marginnote">
Alternately, imagine you are asked 'do you prefer a blargh-colored shirt or a fleem-colored shirt', where blargh and fleem are colors you have never heard of before.
</div>
 
In general, economists' standard approach assumes we have a consistent preference ranking over all possibilities, and choose accordingly.  

However, other social sciences see this differently.

```

<div class="marginnote">
Aside: Also 'forbidden' in the classical model: the *time* or *frame* in which I make the *decisions* must not affect my preferences (or choices). This will be relaxed when we discuss behavioral economics.
</div>

\

**Definition: Completeness** (From O-R)
  

<div class="marginnote">
Also please see my video above.
</div>
 

The property that for all alternatives $x$ and $y$ , distinct or not, either $x \succsim y$ or $y \succsim x$ (or both).   Even more formally (optional)...

```{block2,  type='def'}

**Definition (O-R): Complete binary relation**

A binary relation $R$ on the set $X$ is complete if for all members $x$ and $y$ of $X$, either $x R y$ or $y R x$ (or both).

```  

> A complete binary relation is, in particular, *reflexive*: for every $x \in X$ we have $x R x$.

\

In case you are confused, please unfold the Q & A below...


```{block2,  type='fold'}

**Q:	I am still confused with the concept of ‘reflexivity’ after reading these paragraphs. Does it mean all ‘x’ are the same**

  \

**A: Not exactly,** reflexivity is a property (a characteristic) of the *relation* $R$ (where this 'relation' could be 'greater than', 'smaller than', 'equal', 'having the same number of elements', 'preferred to', etc.), not the property of a 'mathematial object' itself.

Reflexivity  holds where an object always "relates to itself". For example, in standard maths the relationship  'greater than or equal to ($\geq$) is reflexive, while the relationship $\gt$ is *not* reflexive.  For any number $x$ the statement $x \geq x$ is true (e.g., $10 \geq 10$ is true because $10=10$). However, the statement $x>x$ is false ... obviously a number cannot be greater than itself! (Only the Red Queen can exceed her own greatness.)

Sue: Hmmmm, why is $10 \geq 10$ true??? How could 10 possibly be greater than 10? Shouldn't the only correct statement be 10 = 10?
  
DR: Because this is the 'greater than *or* equal to' sign. Of course '10 is greater than or equal to 10' because they are equal. Just as in computer programming, with an 'OR' operator the condition evaluates as true if either (or both) of the conditions are true.

Sue: Ooook, I think I understand it now. It makes sense to me when you linked it with computer programming; **but what is the point of the $\succsim$ sign? Couldn't the authors only use the $\geq$ sign?**

DR: This is in fact a notation from set theory. We are expressing preferences over objects which may not be representable by a single number.
 
\
  
  
Sue: ... **But then why 'completeness' automatically ensures the second property 'reflexivity'? **

DR:  The authors are saying that the first property of the binary relationship, 'completeness' automatically ensures the second property 'reflexivity'. Equivalently (contrapositive statement) "a relationship that is not reflexive can not be complete." 

But they have only *stated* that this is the case. **They have not PROVEN it.** We would have to look up a proof or try to construct it ourselves. They don't give the proof of this in the main text.

```

#### Transitivity {-}


> For a binary relation $\succ$ to correspond to a preference relation, we require not only that it be complete, but also that it be consistent in the sense that if $x \succsim y$ and $y \succsim z$ then $x \succsim z$. This property is called transitivity. (O-R)


Intuitively: Transitive preferences are 'internally consistent': If I prefer A to B, and prefer B to C, then I must prefer A to C.

\


Formally definition of 'transitive binary relation' (optional) 

```{block2,  type='def'}

**Definition: Transitive binary relation** [O-R]
  
A binary relation R on the set $X$ is transitive if for any members $x$ , $y$ , and $z$ of $X$ for which $x R y$ and $y R z$, we have $x R z$.

```

\

Let's explore this more simply in terms of *strict* preferences, the $\succ$ symbol.

Transitivity means:

$$ A \succ B \: and \: B \succ C \rightarrow A \succ C $$


- If I prefer an Apple to a Banana and a Banana to Cherry then I prefer an Apple to a Cherry.


- A similar idea holds if I am indifferent between one pair of these.  ($\sim$)

<div class="marginnote">
The transitivity of the 'indifference relation' $\sim$ is a general property of 'equivalence relations'. 
</div>



- ... this obviously extends to 'chains' combining these ... so

$$ A \succ B \:\: and \: \: B \sim C \rightarrow A \succ C $$
etc.

We may write this concisely as $A \succ B \sim C$.


```{block2,  type='tip'}

If this seems confusing it may be because it is *too* obvious (although behavioral and experimental economists claim to find violations of this, as we shall see).

```

\

*If you found someone who striclty preferred an apple to a bananas, a banana to a cherry, and a cherry to an apple,  you could make a lot of money out of them!.*

```{block2,  type='compq'}

Consider: How would you do this? (Unfold below for a description).

```  

```{block2,  type='fold'}

It works as follows (being a bit informal here):

0. Obtain (or borrow) an apple, a banana and a cherry.

1. Offer to give this person an apple in exchange for their banana plus a tiny little extra small unit of  banana (or 'money').

2. Next offer them a cherry for their apple plus a bit extra.

3. Next offer a banana for their cherry plus a bit extra.

... Keep repeating steps 1-3, until you've drained them of all of their resources.

```

```{block2,  type='note'}

*Feel free to* **skip** the O-R discussion of symmetric and anti-symmetric relations, and also skip the discussion of symmetric/antisymmetric relations, if you want. 

It is fun, but it is *barely* used later in the text. 

```  

\

#### Continuity (for  preferences over certainties) {-#continuity}

```{block2,  type='note'}
Note: I define continuous preferences here, while O-R do not define this until the chapter 'Consumer Preferences'. I'm not sure why they made that choice. Among other things, continuity is relevant for considering which preferences can be represented by a utility function. 

```  


What is continuity?  One definition:

Continuity: If $A \succ B$ and $C$ 'lies within an $\epsilon$ radius of $B$' then $A \succ C$.


More completely, O-R define continuity as:

```{block2,  type='def'}

The preference relation $\succsim$ on $\mathbb{R}^2_{+}$ is continuous if whenever $x \succ y$ there exists a number $\epsilon> 0$ such that for every bundle $a$ for which the distance
to $x$ is less than $\epsilon$ and every bundle $b$ for which the distance to $y$ is less
than  $\epsilon$  we have $a \succ b$ (where the distance between any bundles $(w_1, w_2)$
and $(z_1, z_2)$ is $\sqrt{|w_1 − z_1|^2 + |w_2 − z_2|^2}$
  
  
```

</center>

\

### Possible preferences .. "Preference formation" {#pref-form}

We might derive preference relations from a few "basic considerations", perhaps reflecting how people describe their own preferences (and choices) in conversation.

<div class="marginnote">
These can be considered in terms of individual preferences, or, as we will see later, ways to express group-preferences or social preferences. This is considered the 'axiomatic approach'.
</div>


We will consider a few examples, some of which *do*  satisfy completeness and transitivity, and some of which do not satisfy one or both of these.

\


#### Value functions {-#value_function} 

O-R first consider a 'value function' "$v$ that attaches to each alternative a number" ... the preference relation here "is defined by $x \succsim y$  if and only if $v(x) \geq  v(y)$. 

<div class="marginnote">
This is close to the 'utility function' that we will discuss later. It is trivial to show that this is complete and transitive. (Can you show it?).
</div>

```{block2,  type='warning'}
*Do you know what 'if and only if' means?* This is important. (If you don't know, unfold below.)
```  


```{block2,  type='fold'}

"If and only if" is sometimes depicted as $\leftrightarrow$ (and abbreviated '*iff*').

When we say "statement A holds *if and only* statement B holds", we mean that whenever statement B holds statement A must hold, and also, whenever statement A holds statement B must hold. This also implies that if statement A *does not* hold, statement B *cannot hold* and vice versa. 

Another way of saying this is "statement A is a necessary and sufficient condition for statement B."

For example, in simple algebra we can assert (and prove):
  
> $x > y$ *if and only if* $2x > 2y$, i.e., 
> $x > y \leftrightarrow 2x > 2y$,

To prove the 'if and only if' relationship, you need to prove *both directions* of this relationship. For this example, I would need to show both:

1. $x > y \rightarrow 2x > 2y$ *and*
2. $2x > 2y \rightarrow x > y$. 


If you are struggling with this, you may find the [Khan academy Logic material helpful](https://www.khanacademy.org/test-prep/lsat/lsat-lessons/logic-toolbox-new/a/logic-toolbox--if-and-only-if), as well as more advanced treatments of hte logic of mathematical proofs.

</center>

Maybe you have heard someone say something like:

> I know what I like; there is a perfect life for me. I simply want everything to look as close to this as possible. 

<div class="marginnote">
O-R: "One alternative is “ideal” for the individual; how much he likes every other alternative is determined by the distance of that alternative from the ideal, as given by a function $d$. "
</div>

This might be expressed as the preference relation $\succsim$ defined by

$$x \succsim y \: \leftrightarrow \: d(x) \leq d(y)$$

<div class="marginnote">

We will return to "distance functions" later. We are all familiar with the 'Euclidean distance' function... which happens to represent the actual straight-line distance between two physical objects in three dimensional space. However, there is no obvious single measure of the "distances between two bundles of goods and services, with many measurable attributes."

#### Lexicographic ('lex') preferences {-#lex-pref}

Remember the Blue Cat in the video? ... When he considered his preferences over the teas, he said:

> I care first and foremost about whether the tea box is rectangular. If several boxes are equally rectangular, then I care about which box is the most white.  If the boxes are equally white, then I care about which box is biggest.

This seems to be an example of what we call 'lexicographic preferences'. 

*Why are lexicographic preferences important*? (Think and unfold:)

```{block2,  type='fold'}

Ask people how they make their choices, particularly when they are shopping online. I bet that some people will describe a process of 'ruling out' one set of options after another. This is, in fact an optimal procedure for someone with lex preferences. This is *not optimal* for someone with the more standard preferences you may have seen in economics courses, someone who considers trade-offs between one attribute and another. 

The 'filtering' is also consistent with the standard way data is organised. Try to search for a product or service online (on Amazon, or Kayak): it is hard to *specify* your trade off between different characteristics, but it's easy to 'narrow things down' one category at a time.  

In business data science, some 'tree-based' models of choice implicitly assume lex preferences. Business marketers speak of 'hygiene factors'; if these are not achieved, the customer will walk away.

As stated by O-R: 


> An individual has in mind two [or more] [complete](#Completeness) and [transitive](#Transitivity) binary relations, $\succsim_1$ and $\succsim_2$, each of which relates to one feature of the alternatives. For example, if $X$ is a set of computers, the features might be the size of the memory and the resolution of the screen.

**Are lexicographic (lex) preferences complete?**

```  


```{block2,  type='fold'}

> Its completeness follows from the completeness of $\succsim_1$ and $\succsim_2$. (O-R, p. 7)

-  If we suppose that the 'sub-preference orderings' $\succsim_1$ and $\succsim_2$ can be applied to these features of any alternative...

- then we can apply the procedure above to determine the overall preference ordering $\succsim$ between any two pairings.  

```

\

##### Are lex preferences transitive? {-}


<div class="marginnote">
DR Todo: I intend to add a video here covering this
</div>

> Suppose that $x \succsim y$ and $y \succsim z$. 

*To show transitivity by our definition*, we now need to show that this neccesarily implies that $x \succsim z$ holds. 

<div class="marginnote">

Also note that the above example happens to be perfectly general (we sometimes state this as 'without loss of generality' or 'WLOG'). As we have complete preferences, for any three options, it must be that you can choose labels for them x, y, and z, such that $x \succsim y$ and $y \succsim z$. 

</div>
 
\

There are (only) two possible cases:

<div class="marginnote">
Note that these are the *only* two possible cases. (We know this because case 2 is simply the 'negation' of case 1.  In standard logic either something is true, or it is not true). Thus if we can prove transitivity for both case 1 and case 2, we have proved it 'for all possible cases'. 
</div>
 
  
*Case 1: "The first feature is decisive when comparing $x$ and $y$: $x \succ_1 y$."*

*Case 2: "The first feature is *not* decisive when comparing $x$ and $y$..."*

\

**Considering Case 1**:

Given, by the above assumption, that $y \succsim z$, it must be that $y \succsim_1 z$ 

... i.e., y is "at least as good as z in its first feature" -- otherwise, according to our preferences, y could not be 'at least as good as z').


> so by the transitivity of $\succsim_1$ [which was part of the definition of lex preferences]... 

> we obtain ... $x \succ_1 z$ 

> and thus $x \succsim z$ 
\

Wait, why does  $x \succ_1 y$ combined with $y \succsim_1 z$  imply that  $x \succ_1 z$? (think, and then unfold).

```{block2,  type='fold'}

This seems intuitively obvious: if 'feature 1 of x is strictly better than feature 1 of y' and 'feature 1 of y is at least as good as feature 1 of z', then it should be that 'feature 1 of x is strictly better than feature 1 of z'. But if we are compulsive mathematicians, we would need to actually formally prove this, as Problem 1b requests.  

```

\


... And why does $x \succ_1 z$ imply that $x \succsim z$? (think, and then unfold)


```{block2,  type='fold'}

By condition (i) in the definition of lex preferences, if $x \succ_1 y$ then $x \succsim y$. (Obviously, as this is a general definition, it also applies if we swap z for y in this statement.)

```

\

..."but wait, why aren't you stating  $x \succsim z$ ('x is at least as good as z')... don't we know that $x \succ z$, ('x is strictly preferred to z')? (unfold)

```{block2,  type='fold'}

Three responses:
  
-  For this case, $x \succ z$ does not come directly out of the definition of lex preferences. (I think this could be derived, but we do not need to.)

- Our definition of transitivity involves the $\succsim$ operator, and not the $\succ$ operator; we need to prove it precisely as defined.

- Anyways, $x \succ y$ *implies* $x \succsim y$ (but not vice versa). $\succsim$ is the 'weaker' condition.  So if $x \succ y$ is a true statement then $x \succsim y$ is as well (always).

```

\

*Wait we are not done! We only proved this for one case; now we must consider the 'negation' of this case:*


**Considering Case 2... **:  "The first feature is *not* decisive when comparing $x$ and $y$: $x \sim_1 y$ 

...(and $x \succsim_2 y$ must hold as we assumed that $x \succsim y$ overall.)

Case 2 is further broken down into two comprehensive sub-cases, which I will call 2a and 2b.  Given that the first feature is not decisive for comparing x and y...

...then either the first feature is decisive when comparing y and z ('case 2a'), or it is not ('case 2b').

*Either... *

**2a:** $y \succ_1 z$ 

... then ...  "we obtain $x \succ_1 z$ and therefore $x \succsim z$."

<div class="marginnote">
O-R write  that this follows "from the transitivity of $\succ_1$".
I believe that here they mean we know that if $A \sim B$ and $B \succ C$ then $A \succ C$ by the property of these logical relations $\sim$ and $\succ$. 

Thus we must have that  $x \sim_1 y$ and $y \succ_1 z$ implies $z \succ_1 z$ 
</div>

*or*

**2b:** $y \sim_1 z$ 

implying that $y \succ_2 z$ for y to be preferred to z overall, as assumed. 

> By the transitivity of $\sim_1$ we obtain $x \sim_1 z$ ...

(recalling $x \sim_1 y$ is what defined case 2)...


> and by the transitivity of $\succsim_2$ we obtain $x \succsim_2 z$. Thus $x \succsim z$.

Thus we have shown, for all possible cases that, or lexicographic preferences $\succsim$ as defined [above](#lex-pref), $x \succsim y$ and $y \succsim z$, implying that these preferences are transitive. 

We can now write *quo erat demonstrandum* or 'Q.E.D', meaning 'what was to be demonstrated' [has been demonstrated]. This is sometimes expressed with the symbol

$$\blacksquare$$.

I think it is good for you to get a sense of what mathematical/theoretical economics proofs look like. It's good for improving the rigorous structure of your arguments in general. It may be helpful for future reading. It helps you be sure that you understand the concepts defined. 

\

Also, we learned a few concepts here in doing this. I would suggest that we learned things like...

- A proof can constructed by demonstrating that something must hold for all possible cases. We can do it by dividing up the space of all possible cases and showing it for each part of this space.

- The idea of "weaker and stronger conditions" (strict vs weak preference)

- How to use ‘general properties of mathematical objects’ (like the transitivity of the $\succsim$ operator) to construct proofs for specific cases.

- Mathematical and logical arguments often contain *many simple steps*, perhaps too many to keep in your head all at the same time. That's why it's important to write things down and not try to do everything in 'spoken form.'

However, as this is so time-consuming, and not always insightful, I won't drag you through all the proofs... only dip in occassionally.

#### Unanimity rule {-#unanimity}



> The individual has in mind $n$ considerations, represented by the complete and transitive binary relations $\succsim_1, \succsim_2,..., \succsim_n$.

> For example, a parent  may take in account the preferences of her $n$ children. 

\

<div class="marginnote">
 
In the movie (and book) "Sophie's choice" a mother is asked to make a horrible choice [very disturbing clip here](https://www.youtube.com/embed/DZ9bht5H2p4?start=214). This may be a case in which we think preferences are not 'complete'; we cannot express preferences among our children's lives. 

</div>

\


Or, getting back to our basic idea, an individual may simply have preferences over $n$ characteristics of an outcome (or a product, or a bundle of products)

> Define the binary relation $\succsim$ by $x \succsim y$ if $x \succsim_i y$ for $i = 1,...,n$.

In other words, this may be is a person who says something like:

`r format_with_col("I only prefer a holiday in Jamaica to a holiday in France if Jamaica is better than France in all attributes (or vice-versa). Otherwise I can't say anything about it.", "gray")`

\

Or a group policy-maker who says (unfold):

```{block2,  type='fold'}

Group PM: "I can only state that we prefer the Conservatives' policy is better than the Liberals'  if it is better for everyone in our society (or vice-versa). Otherwise, we don't have a group preference."

In fact, these precise definitions of preferences, and their characteristics, are useful in considering the idea of 'public choice' and social welfare functions. We may derive things like 'impossibility theorems' that tell us the limits of what group-decision-making can accomplish.

O-R discuss this in chapter 20, 'Aggregating preferences', but we probably won't have time to cover it directly in this module.

```



<div class="marginnote">
DR Todo: I intend to add a video here discussing this
</div>

```{block2,  type='fold'}

If 'two of the relations disagree' when comparing any two elements in the choice set (x and y), then the condition 'x is at least as good as y in all aspects' does not hold, nor does 'y is at least as good as x in all aspects' hold. So the unanimity preference relation 'rule' does not state that either is preferred.

Maybe this is obvious when you think in the group context: If we can only make a decision if everyone agrees that one option is better than the other, there will be cases where we cannot say either way which is preferred.

```

\

The 'unanimity rule'-based preferences are not complete, which suggests this has limited use as a decision rule (when we get to actual 'choice'). 


\


'Majority rule' (read about this in O-R) solves this problem but brings another problem, which leads to the 'Condorcet paradox', also known as the 'voting paradox'.  After reading this in O-R, unfold below for an example of how this makes it difficult to clearly express 'public choice' through majority voting. 

```{block2,  type='fold'}

**Voting paradox example** 
  
Suppose we are trying to choose, as a society, between three options in our choice set $X$: a Green Park, Public Housing, or Private Housing.
  
\

Suppose we have a local council with one member from each party (representing equal-sized constituencies). Preferences of these groups are as follows (considering strict preferences; as O-R state, the preferences here are 'anti-symmetric'):

  \

Green party: Green Park $\succ$ Public housing $\succ$ Private housing \

Labour: Public housing $\succ$ Private Housing $\succ$ Green Park \

Conservatives: Private Housing $\succ$ Green Park $\succ$ Public housing \


\

Suppose we have a local council with one member of each party (representing equal-sized constituencies).

\

Which proposal would win if they voted on:
- a Green park versus Public housing?
- a Green Park versus Private housing?
- Private housing versus Public housing?


\

*Try each vote and see who wins*.

\



  
*Does a majority vote reveal a clear 'consistent social preference'?*

No, not here.


```


#### Are preferences transitive in the real world? {-}

In the [O-R questionnaire](http://gametheory.tau.ac.il/exp11/) they asked people to make 36 choices between pairs of alternatives taken from a set of 9 alternatives.

> Each alternative is a description of a vacation package with four parameters: the city, hotel quality, food quality, and price.

They varied the ordering of the description of these features.

```{block2,  type='note'}
You might want to do that survey now if you haven't done it yet, to understand what we are talking about.
```  

e.g., one choice could be between 

- "A weekend in Paris, with 4 star hotel, food quality 17, for 574 USD" versus 
- "A weekend in Berlin, with 5 star hotel, food quality 15, for 500 USD"

\

They found that 85% of the roughly 1300 showed at least one 'intransitivity', where their stated preferences implied "A is preferred to B", "B is preferred to C", and "C is preferred to A" for some combination of three alternatives. 

<div class="marginnote">
Or they simply reversed themselves, stating 'A is preferred to B' in one case and 'B is preferred to A' in another case. That is also a violation of transitivity, of course.
</div>

They also note that

> the order in which the features of the package are listed has an effect on the expressed preferences.

This is something we call a 'framing effect'; the way an option is stated affects people's choices (or stated preferences). 

<div class="marginnote">
This is a major discussion in behavioral economics. Framing effects include things like 'anchoring', 'halo effects', 'decoy effects', etc. (Look up what some of these mean if you are interestef). Framing effects might be interpreted as a violation of the idea of 'transitive preferences'. On the other hand, one  might  argue instead that 'the frame is itself a characteristic of the product.'

</div>
 
 
```{block2,  type='inputq'}

**Do the results of the O-R survey demonstrate that 'people frequently exhibit intransitive preferences'?** Consider why this may or may not be considered definitive evidence (and then unfold below for some suggestions.)
```  

\

```{block2,  type='fold'}

This may be *suggestive* evidence, but I don't think it should be considered definitive. 

One possible objection... These were 'hypothetical' questions; no one was actually making real choices here. In contrast, Economics research usually emphasizes real 'incentivised' choices, either in lab or field experiments or relying on 'observational' data. Thinking about these choices carefully is mentally costly. Respondents may not have put in the time to carefully consider these choices.

## Utility functions {#util}


<center>

Video: "A utility function represents preferences"

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/9TwugICeJfw" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

</center>

Recall, a ['value function'](#valfunc) simply assigns a real number to each alternative. A *Utility function* is simply a value function which 'represents preferences'. 

```{block2,  type='def'}

**Utility function** (O-R definition)

For any set $X$ and preference relation $\succsim$ on $X$, the function $u : X \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ represents $\succsim$  if

$$x \succsim y \text{ if and only if } u(x) \geq u(y)$$
We say that $u$ is 'a utility function for $\succsim$.

```  

<div class="marginnote">
$u : X \rightarrow R$ means that the function $u$ takes any element in the set $X$ (perhaps each element is a combination of goods, services, and leisure time) and returns a real number.
</div>

\

```{block2,  type='inputq'}

To make this concrete...

Can you construct a utility function that 'represents' preferences $a \succ b \sim c \succ d$ on the set \{a,b,c,d\} (Unfold)
  
```  

```{block2,  type='fold'}

One such utility function (O-R page 9)
  
$u(a)=5$, 
$u(b)=u(c)=-1$, 
$u(d)=-17$.

Of course many other utility functions also represent these preferences. 

```
 
 \
 
#### Aside: 'what is utility' and what does it mean? {-}

`r format_with_col("There is some debate about the meaning and interpretation of utility, particularly in the Behavioural Economics literature ","RawSienna")` 

Although the NS text describes it as "The pleasure or satisfaction that people get from their economic activity" I think that most economists do *not* see it that way.

Perhaps the modern non-behavioral definition of utility would be 'the thing that drives choices, subject to constraints'.

So if utility is (at best) defined as 'the thing that people maximise', does it have any meaning, or does it simply lead to circular reasoning? 

```{block2,  type='inputq'}
What do you think?
```  

(My thoughts in the fold).

```{block2,  type='fold'}
My opinion is that there is some 'bite'. 

A defining feature of the standard Economics approach is that decisions are made as if all characteristics of outcomes can be compared and evaluated, thus we can reduce everything to a single dimension, 'utility', which is maximised. Other social sciences often reject this.
```


Also note that behavioral economics often separates preferences from choices, as in the O-R text, and some models even separate 'choice-utility' from 'realized utility.'  

\





**Consider: Measuring and comparing utilities** (unfold)

In general,  we don't imagine that we can somehow measure an individual's actual 'amount' of utility. To the extent that we can measure it at all, it is only inferred indirectly, from the *choices* people make.


<div class="marginnote">
 See  D. Colander 'Edgeworth's Hedonimeter and the Quest to Measure Utility'' Journal of Economic Perspectives, Spring 2007: 215-225 for a discussion of the history of this idea.
</div>


\

So utility is not 'directly observable and measurable'. 


<div class="marginnote">
Unlike midi-chlorians or thetans.
</div>


<br> \bigskip


Utility is seen to govern an individual's *choices* and thus only inferred indirectly, from the *choices* an people make.

\


**Consider: Revealed preference:** 

if Al buys a cat instead of a dog, and a dog was cheaper, we assume Al gets more utility from a cat


```{r  fig.cap = 'Al and his cat', out.width='40%', fig.asp=.4, fig.align='center',  echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("picsfigs/alscat.jpg")
```


Such methods are used to try to measure the value of goods that have no observed market price, for public policy choices.

<div class="marginnote">
E.g., If people drove 20km to go to parK B, they must value it at at least the cost of driving there.

If people pay £20k more for a house with a view of the lake (ceteris paribus), or in a neighborhood with better air quality...

</div>

\

This raises another issue: can we compare whether one person gets 'more' or 'less' utility than another? Can we know whether a policy can "increase one person's utility more than it decreases another person's utility"? These issues are considered in  modeling social welfare and social choices. 

<div class="marginnote">
 In more detailed discussions, we might speak of 'cardinal utility', 'ordinal utility'. 
</div>
 
Empirically, it is hard to imagine how these could be measured: if utility is only indirectly and partially observable through an individual's choices... when do we observe choices that trade off between one person and another in ways that reflect the 'sum of their utilities'? 

<div class="marginnote">
Never, I think. 
</div>
 
 

### When can utility functions 'represent preferences'? 

```{block2,  type='note'}

The rest of this section in O-R is highly abstract and I don't see many direct applications to practice. You can skip much of it, but please do cover the parts mentioned below.
```  

\

Here O-R give a fancy definition of 'maximal element with respect to $\succsim$' ... basically, the 'best or (at least tied-for-best) element in the set, considering these preferences.'

Similarly for the 'minimal' element.

\

O-R Lemma 1.1 ... in any 'nonempty finite set' there must be at least one minimal and at least one maximal element. This is pretty obvious and intuitive. 

Still, it is worth reading over the *proof* of this as it gives you an easy example of 'proof by induction'. The logic of 'proof by induction'... (to prove that something holds for a set of any countable size $N$):

1. Show statement X holds for the first element (here, for $n=1$)
2. Show that 'if X holds for any element $n-1$ it must also hold for element $n$'
3.  Putting 1 and 2 together, you now know that statement X must always hold (for any countable finite set of some size $N$). 'Just start with the first element and count up to N'. 

\

*Aside: is there a 'smallest interesting integer number'? Can you prove why or why not?*

```{block2,  type='fold'}
No, there cannot be, I can 'prove it'. Suppose there that $K$ were the 'smallest interesting integer'. But then integer $K-1$ would be the 'largest *non-interesting* number.' That fact alone should make it interesting! Therefore, there cannot be any smallest interesting integer!
  
(I think this passes for a joke in the maths community.)

```


\

The following proposition, and other propositions extending this, are  fundamental to the idea that we can conduct our economic analysis *as if* people actually consulted a utility function. 

```{block2,  type='def'}

Proposition (O-R 1.1): Every preference relation on a finite set can be represented by a utility function. 

```  

Note that this requires *a finite set*; this must involve a countable number of elements to choose among. It is not guaranteed (at least not without further conditions) for a preference relation on an infinite set. For example, the set of elements 'any real number between 0 and 10' is an infinite set. 

*You may skip the proof of this proposition, if you like.*

#### Examples: lexicographic preferences on a finite set {-} 

Lexicographic preference on a *finite* set (like the set of seats in a movie theatre) *can* be represented by a utility function,

Following O-R example 1.2:

- Suppose an individual prefers to sit as far back as possible (in the highest numbered 'row'). This is her first priority.
- Within any 'row' she prefers to sit as far to the left as possible (in the highest numbered 'column')

\

```{block2,  type='inputq'}

```  


<div class="marginnote">
DR Todo: I hope to add a video here discussing this
</div>

```{block2,  type='fold'}

Just rank the seat preferences, and assign the lowest utility number to the least-preferred seat (most front and right). Then increase the utility by 1 as you move each seet to the left. Then start at the next row back, all the way to the right, adding 1 to the utility, etc. 
\

O-R give another (equivalent) utility function for this, noting that, for this example there are 40 rows of seats and 50 columns (50 seats per row).
  
$$u(x)=50 r(x) - c(x) + 1$$ 

where $r(x)$ is the row number and $c(x)$ the column number. 
(I'm not sure why they added the '+1', there is no need for a utility number to be positive.)
  
```

#### Allowing for infinite sets: *some* (but not all) preferences can be represented by a utility function {-}

There are 'important' economic theorems specifying 'sufficient conditions for preferences to be represented by a utility function'. We will consider this briefly.


'Continuous preferences' (defined [above](#continuity)) as well as completeness and transitivity  $\rightarrow$ a utility representation; these are jointly sufficient conditions for preferences to be represented by a utility function. Continuous preferences will also ensure continuous utility functions and allow us to discuss concepts such as 'marginal utility' and ensure and gradually sloping demand curves.

</center>

<div class="marginnote">
Note that everywhere-differentiable utility functions are continuous.
</div>
 
However, 'lexicographic' preferences are not continuous and, on an infinite set, they cannot be represented by a utility function (see video below).

\


\

For example, consider the infinite set $\mathbb{R}^+$, the set of all non-negative real numbers. This is a reasonable choice set to consider, perhaps, in some contexts. E.g., 'I may be able to consume any zero or positive amount of food' ( note we have not yet brought in *constraints*, we are just considering *preferences*). 

Suppose 'I always find more food at least as good as less food'. We could represent this preference as

In contrast, consider lex preferences on an *infinite* set, the 'unit square", where the first priority is the first coordinate and the second priority is the second coordinate.

### An increasing function of a ('regular'\*) utility function represents the same preferences


<div class="marginnote">
O-R say 'Increasing function of a utility function is a utility function'. But it's more than this. It is the *same utility function*, yielding the same choices.

\* Note that I say 'regular utility function'. When we consider uncertainty in the 'expected utility' framework, this will not hold with respect to 'increasing transformations' of the functions we will be dealing with, only with respect to 'affine (linear) transformations'.

<div class="marginnote">
\* Note in the above video I equivocated over whether unanimity preferences can be represented by a utility function. Such preference are *not complete*, so they cannot be fully represented: where one bundle is better by one criteria and another by a different criteria, we cannot assign utility numbers to either of these bundles. 
</div>
 



This is pretty important because it gives us a sense of how closely we might be able to identify a utility function. As O-R note: 

> if the function $u(x,y)$ represents a given preference relation then so does the function $3u(x,y) −7$ [for example]

This means that even if we knew a persons' preferences, we wouldn't know whether the utility function was "actually" $U(Apples, Bananas) = A + B^2$  or $U(Apples, Bananas) = 4(A + B^2)^3 + 37$ etc. These utility functions express the same preferences. 


In general:

<div class="marginnote">

The notation here is a bit loose perhaps? 
When we say $x \in X$ we are considering elements $x$ that may have multiple components... $x$ may be a bundle of goods and services, etc., so $u(x)$ may be a function of several variables.
</div>
 

```{block2,  type='def'}
O-R Proposition 1.3: 

Let $f : \mathbb{R}  \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ be an increasing function (\*). If $u$ represents the preference relation $\succsim$  on $X$ , then so does the function $w$ defined by $w(x) = f(u(x))$ for all $x \in X$.

```  

\

The proof is pretty quick and reasonable:

```{block2,  type='def'}

$w(x) \geq w (y)$ means is the same thing as saying $f(u(x)) \geq f(u(y))$, by the above definition. 

Because $f$ is an *increasing function* (\*), $f(u(x)) \geq f(u(y))$ holds if and only if $u(x) \geq u(y)$.
  
$u(x) \geq u(y)$ is true if and only if $x \succsim y$, by the definition of utility functions 'representing preferences.'
 
```  

<div class="marginnote">
\* An *increasing function* is simply a function that increases in its arguments. By definition, $f$ is an increasing function if and only if $f(a)>f(b)$ whenever $a>b$.

```

### Choice and rational choice 

> Recall ... a preference relation refers only to the individual's mental attitude, not to the choices she may make. In this chapter, we describe a concept of choice, independently of preferences. (O-R, p. 17)

<div class="marginnote">

The separation of Preferences and Choice in their text, into separate concepts and chapters, is a bit unusual. I suspect that this reflects how these are often separated in Behavioral Economics; unlike in classical Economics, choices might *not* simply optimise with respect to an individual's preferences (and 'experienced' utility). 

</div>

#### Choice problems, choice functions {-}
 
```{block2,  type='def'}

> Given a set $X$, a choice problem for $X$ is a nonempty subset of $X$...

> and a choice function for $X$ associates with every choice problem $A \in X$ a single member of $A$ (the member chosen).

(O-R, def 2.1)

```  

This is 'dense language'. In more plain English, a 'choice problem' is a subset of alternatives (perhaps those alternatives which are 'feasible' for the individual to choose among).

A 'choice function' specifies 'for any given (sub)set of alternatives, which one will be chosen'?

\

#### Rationality defined {-}

O-R loosely define a rational individual as an individual who:

- has a [preference relation (as defined above)](#pref-def) over (any) set $X$,
- is aware of the set of possible alternatives (whenever she needs to choose), and
- always "chooses an alternative that is best according to her preference relation over the set of possible alternatives".

<div class="marginnote">
 But this allows *any* set of preferences; even 'preference for apparent pain'. This is perhaps a 'weak' definition of rationality.
</div>



<div class="marginnote">
TODO: I intend to include a video here 
</div>

\

**Let's call this rational individual 'Ratchell'**.

\


#### Utility-maximizing choice {-}

If... 

1. Ratchell's preferences can be *[represented](#util) by* the utility function* $u$ and 

2. he is rational in the sense defined above (he chooses the 'best feasible option' according to his preferences) ...

...then his 'choice function' will solve the 'problem' 

$$ max\{u(x): x \in A\}$$.

We read this as "he chooses x to maximize the utility function $u(x)$ under the constraint that $x$ is in the 'feasible' set $A$." \* 

<div class="marginnote">
\* Set $A$:  This may be the set of all alternatives Ratchell can afford to buy given his wealth, or the set of combination of goods and liesure time he can consume given his productivity and the prices he faces in the market, etc. 
</div>


Utility (simple definition)
:     "The pleasure or satisfaction that people get from their economic activity."
:     Alt: The thing that people maximise when making economic decisions



<div class="marginnote">
There is some debate about the meaning and interpretation of utility, particularly in the Behavioural Economics literature.

A defining feature of the standard Economics approach is that decisions are made as if all characteristics of outcomes can be compared and evaluated, thus we can reduce everything to a single dimension, 'utility', which is maximised.
</div>
 
\


#### Utility from two goods (simpler digression) {-}

Stepping away from O-R now, we may specify a "utility function" of two goods (or aggregations of goods) $X$ and $Y$. 

```{block2,  type='tip'}
This may be familiar from your undergraduate work. If so, you can skip this sub-section and go directly to ['rationalising choice'](#rat-choice)

``` 

$$Utility = U(X,Y; other)$$

We can get a lot of insight from considering models of an individual's preferences over only two goods. These two 'goods' could represent, for example:

- Leisure and 'goods consumption'

- Food and non-food

- Coffee and tea (holding all else constant)


\

```{block2,  type='note'}
Empirical aside:  can we 'aggregate goods' in this way?  (Unfold below)
```

```{block2,  type='fold'}
E.g., considering a 3-good case... do the preferences of bananas vs apples depend on the *composition* of the (e.g.) housing services bundle, or only on some aggregated measure of 'housing sevices'. In estimating demand systems and considering price elasticities we may want/need to make such assumptions. (See, e.g., 'nested logit' models.)
```


<br> \bigskip

Recall $U(X,Y)$ expresses a *function* with two *arguments*, X and Y.

$U(X,Y)$ must take *some* value for every positive value of X and Y.

In  *general* a function of X and Y might increase or decrease in either X or Y, or increase over some ranges and decrease over other ranges of these two arguments.

<br> \bigskip

For example, consider the function 'altitude of land in Britain as a function of degrees longitude and latitude'.

$U(X,Y)$ expresses a *general* function; I haven't specified *what* this function is.

E.g., it could be $U(X,Y)=\sqrt(XY)$.

Individuals' utility functions may differ, of course.

### Rationalizing choice {#rat-choice}
 
We are not saying people *actually* consult a utility function or maximize a preference relation. That would be a dumb thing to say. We are considering that 'people behave as if they are maximizing utility functions'; this is (basically) equivalent to saying "people choose based on preferences that satisfy the above assumptions."

\

So, what do we really mean? We might consider whether people's choices are 'rationalizable'... whether their choices *might* be explainable by choosing according to a (transitive) preference relation (or maximizing a utility function.)

\

<center>
Defining 'a rationalizable choice function':

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/1JEht-HGPtA" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</center>
\

OR's definition:

<div class="marginnote">
Note: this definition of rationalizability is distinct from the one I will present when considering game theory. I will give that one a different name.
</div>


> A choice function is *rationalizable* if there is a preference relation such that for every choice problem the alternative specified by the choice function is the best alternative according to the preference relation.
 

Remember: a *choice function* assigns a choice to every set of alternatives.  For example, suppose the following three alternatives are potentially under consideration... $X = \{a,b,c\}$:

a: an apple and a carrot
b: an apple (and no carrot)
c: three apples, four carrots, and a spiderman costume

There are four possible 'non-trivial' choice sets among these alternatives (unfold):

```{block2,  type='fold'}

1. $\{a,b\}$: Choose between 'an apple and a carrot' and 'only an apple'
2. $\{a,c\}$: Choose between '1 apple and 1 carrot' and '3 apples, 4 carrots, and 1 spiderman costume' 
3. $\{b,c\}$: ...
4. $\{a,b,c\}$: Choose between  '1 apple and 1 carrot', '1 apple and no carrot', and '3 apples, 4 carrots, and 1 spiderman costume'
```

\

A choice function must assign an individual's choice to any of the above choice sets. For example it might assign 

- $\{a,b\} \rightarrow a$
- $\{a,c\} \rightarrow c$
- $\{b,c\} \rightarrow b$
- $\{a,b,c\} \rightarrow a$

Could this (above) be 'rationalised' by any preferences? (Unfold)

```{block2,  type='fold'}
No it can not! See O-R example 3.1 for a further discussion.

```

In fact, in observed data, people seem to often make choices with intransitivities. 

There are other 'choice rules' that we might imagine people use that also cannot be rationalised by any preferences. For example (O-R 2.3), ... suppose... 


<div class="marginnote">
DR Todo: I hope to add a video here discussing this
</div>

>  From any set A of available alternatives, the individual chooses a median alternative.

This example relates to a proposed 'middle-choice' norm in behavioral economics. (Unfold...)

```{block2,  type='fold'}
It is at least folk wisdom that customers tend to choose 'middle choices' (e.g., a 'medium Coke') among a set of alternatives. Note that this means that even unchosen 'irrelevant alternatives' may affect their behavior. 

E.g., if offered
"Set S": {10ml, 50ml, 100ml} this person chooses 50ml. 

But if offered
"Set L"  {50ml, 100ml, 200ml}, this person chooses 100ml.

But the 50ml and 100ml were available in both sets S and L. In this hypothetical example, the 'irrelevant alternative' caused their choice to change!
  
```

As O-R show (Example 2.2., p 19), this choice function *cannot* be rationalised (unless we re-define the choices in terms of their position, see O-R discussion.)

\

Is *this* rationalizable? :

> The waiter informs him ... he may have either broiled salmon at 2.50 USD or steak at 4.00 USD. ... he elects the salmon. Soon after the waiter returns from the kitchen ... to  tell him that fried snails and frog’s legs are [also available] for 4.50 USD  each. ... his response is “Splendid, I’ll change my order to steak”.

<div class="marginnote">
This comes from Luce (1957) [@luceTheoryIndividualChoice1957], as cited by O-R.
</div>
 


O-R (Ex 2.3) explain why this seemingly perverse behavior *could* be rationalizable, because of the *information conveyed*.

\

<div class="marginnote">
 
O-R's example '2.4 Partygoer' is also interesting; I think the point here is that in a social setting these alternatives cannot be depicted simply as discrete options. The 'offers made and accepted' is part of the value of each alternative.

This translation from straightforward payoffs to payoffs that depend on the nature of the strategic interaction is explored in my paper 'Losing Face' [@gallLosingFace2020] (as well as in much previous work; I'm just self-promoting here).

#### Property $\alpha$ {-}

<center>

Property alpha defined:

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/eJhr93R1tO4" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

</center>
  


The above 'violations' and the discussion of 'irrelevant alternatives' relate to what O-R refer to as:

```{block2,  type='def'}

**Property $\alpha$ **: 
  
> Given a set X, a choice function $c$ for $X$ satisfies property $\alpha$ if ...

> for any sets $A$ and $B$ with $B  \subset A \subseteq X$ and $c(A) \in B$ we have $c(B) = c(A)$.

```  

\

*Explaining the above notation:*

"a choice function $c$ for $X$": a function $c$ that takes any of the choice sets made from the elements of $X$ as an argument, and outputs the choice made.

\


"for any sets $A$ and $B$ with $B  \subset A \subseteq X$": For any choice sets where $B$ is a 'proper subset of $A$'... 
    - "proper subset"... meaning that set $A$ has all the elements that set $B$ has, and $A$ also has at least one more element.

<div class="marginnote">
For example,  B: {fish, giraffe}, is a *proper subset of* A: {fish, giraffe, turnip}.
</div>

"$A \subseteq X$":  $A$ is subset of $X$... it contains none, some or all of the elements in $X$ (but $A$ doesn't contain any elements that are *not* in $X$)

"... and $c(A) \in B$:" Where the choice made when presented with set $A$ is also part of choice set $B$.
\

"... we have $c(B) = c(A)$":  the same element must then be chosen when presented with sets $A$ or $B$.

\

*In other words*: Property-$\alpha$ requires that if you make a particular choice (say 'fish') from a larger menu ($A$) you must also choose 'fish' when you are given a reduced version of that menu. 

Going in the other direction... Suppose  I choose 'fish' from a small menu ($B$). Next I am presented a menu  $A$ that includes all of menu $B$ plus (e.g.) some 'dairy choices'. Property $\alpha$ says that if I don't choose any of the new 'dairy choices' on this larger menu, I must continue to choose the fish. The 'irrelevant alternatives' can not affect my choice.

\

```{block2,  type='def'}
O-R  Proposition 2.1: 
  
> Every rationalizable choice function satisfies property $\alpha$.

```  

If (A) a choice function is rationalizable then (B) it must satisfy property $\alpha$. $(A) \rightarrow (B)$. 

<!-- 
By the standard rules of logic (which are based on set theory, by the way) $(A) \rightarrow (B) \leftrightarrow \: \text{'not' } (A) \rightarrow \text{'not' } (B)$.

What this means: if a choice function *does not* satisfy property $\alpha$ (if irrelevant alternatives *do* impact choices), then it *is not* rationalizable. 

<div class="marginnote">
This does *not* imply that satisfying property-$\alpha$ implies, by itself, that a choice function *is* rationalizable.  Property-$\alpha$ is a 'necessary but not sufficient condition' for rationalizability.

</div>

</center>

\

### Satisficing

People may say they choose by "choosing the first option that meets a level that is 'good enough', and then I quit". O-R formalise this in their section 2.4. This choice procedure *is* rationalizable (You can skim this, you don't need to do the proof.) 

<div class="marginnote">
This should not be confused with 'search models' and the ['optimal stopping problem'](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optimal_stopping). We are not considering search costs here.
</div>
 
### The 'Money pump' argument 

One argument for why choices must reflect transitive preferences is that "behavior that is inconsistent with rationality could produce
choices that harm the individual" (O-R, p. 23). Perhaps we should imagine that biological evolution would have 'weeded out' such individuals, or that their parents would teach them to do otherwise. 


\

Consider:

\

```{block2,  type='inputq'}

If you found someone who strictly preferred a apple to a bananas, a banana to a cherry, and a cherry to an apple,  you could make a lot of money out of them. How would you illustrate this?


```  

<div class="marginnote">
This is easiest to illustrate if we allow these goods to be non-discrete and assume 'more is always better'... this is a bit of a fudge, but it's OK.
</div>
 
Unfold for a simple depiction
```{block2,  type='fold'}
It works as follows:


0. Obtain (or borrow) an apple, a banana and a cherry.

1. Offer to give this person an apple in exchange for their banana plus a tiny little extra small unit of  banana (or 'money').

2. Next offer them a cherry for their apple plus a bit extra.

3. Next offer a banana for their cherry plus a bit extra.

... Keep repeating steps 1-3, until you've drained all of their resources.


```

\

O-R present this slightly more formally (you can skip the formality if you like).



```{block2,  type='supplement'}

**An interesting video discussing this**

[Becoming a money pump, Nick Chater, Warwick business school](https://view.vzaar.com/1387870/video)

An interesting discussion of 'money pumps' (and 'Dutch books') in terms of preferences and financial markets. I've seen this chocolate beverage argument presented for why people should not have 'wide zones of indifference'.

```


### Framing and 'decoy options'  

O-R next present a case where a third 'decoy' option has a substantial affect on people's choices, even though people rarely choose it!

The standard story: "A" is better than "B" in one dimension, but worse in another dimension; people are evenly split between A and B. 

However, if a third alternative "C" is added to the choice set, and C is 'worse in all ways than B' (but still better than A in some ways). Now people tend to choose B.

This 'decoy effect' (aka, "asymmetrically dominated choice", aka "the attraction effect" ) is widely discussed in behavioral economics and marketing. 

Dan Ariely gives a presentation on this below; see also [this article](https://theconversation.com/the-decoy-effect-how-you-are-influenced-to-choose-without-really-knowing-it-111259#:~:text=The%20decoy%20effect%20is%20defined,or%20%E2%80%9Casymmetric%20dominance%20effect%E2%80%9D) in 'The Conversation'.

</iframe>

\

O-R next discuss 'framing effects' in the context of roulette wheel choices; people make distinct choices in choice problems that are *identical, other than the way that they are described.*

<div class="marginnote">
The 'decoy effect' is (arguably) not a framing effect, because the choice set is actually changing. 

We will come back to framing effects when we consider decisions about uncertainty, and the idea of 'loss aversion'.

</div>
 
Clearly these cannot reflect rationalizable preferences unless we make the *description* part of the preference itself.

\

Think about this and give it a try. You can skip the 'antisymmetric' part.  I will share a suggested answer.


<div class="marginnote">
I assign this problem to give you a sense of:

- 'How the $\succ$ operator is defined based on the $\succsim$ operator' (as previously asserted)

- What proofs look like using these operators.

Consider this optional... but at least worth having a quick look at to *understand* the proof. 
</div>


<!-- 

```{block2,  type='fold'}

Transitivity: Assume $x \succ y$ and $y \succ z$. 
*To show transitivity of the $\succ$ operator, we simply need to show that this implies that $x \succ z$.

\


By the above definition of $\succ$, this implies that:
  
1.  $x \succsim y$ is true, and 
2.  $y \succsim z$ is true

but

- $y \succsim x$ is *false*, and 
- $z \succsim y$ is also.
\


We've already shown that $\succsim$ is transitive. Given this  transitivity, we know that points 1 and 2 above imply that $x \succsim z$.

\

*Remember, we are trying to show that $x \succ z$.* To show this, by our definition of $\succ$ we need to show that:

A. $x \succsim z$ (as we have just done) *and*

B. ... show that $z \succsim x$ does NOT hold (which we show now...) 

Let's consider the thing we are trying to disprove, and show that it cannot hold. If, indeed $z \succsim x$ then the transitivity of $\succsim$ would imply that $z \succsim y$ (because point 1 above noted that $x \succsim y$). But this would contradict $y \succ z$, as assumed. 

Thus, $z \succsim x$ can NOT hold. 

Hence, we have shown points A and B, thus showing that 

$$x \succ y \text{and} y \succ z \rightarrow   z \succ x$$, 
thus showing the transitivity of $\succ$.

> An individual has preferences over the set of units 

<!-- in an apartment building. He prefers a unit with 5 rooms on floor 12 to one with 4 rooms on floor 20, one with 4 rooms on floor 5 to one with 2 rooms on floor 12, and one with 2 rooms on floor 20 to one with 5 rooms on floor
-->

(Not assigned, but maybe helpful ... Part A: "Show that the individual’s preference are consistent with a preference relation.")

```{block2,  type='fold'}
We want preference relations that lead to the *strict preferences* stated in the problem....
 
$$(5, 12) \succ (4, 20)$$
$$(4, 5) \succ (2, 12)$$
and 
$$(2, 20) \succ (5,5)$$
  
Where the first element in each pairing  is 'rooms' and the second element is 'floor'.

Recall the $\succ$  meaning 'strictly preferred' is defined as
$A \succ B$ if  $A \succsim B$ but not  $B \succsim A$.

\

OK, we could merely restate the preferences above. But perhaps we want to generalise. 

One preference relation (but not the only one) over all pairs $(r,l)$ that is consistent with the preferences given above is defined by

 
$(r,l) \succsim (r′,l′)$ if and only if either

 

1. $r \geq r′$ and $(r,l) \neq (5,5)$, or

2. $(r′,l′) = (5,5)$.


\

Why the "and $(r,l) \neq (5,5)$" in point 1?

Considering the $(2, 20) \succ (5,5)$ preference ... try the above rule applied in both directions:
 
First, is (2, 20) weakly preferred to  (5,5)?


1. $r ≥ r′$ and $(r,l) \neq  (5,5)$ $\rightarrow$ FALSE (because $r<r'$), so go to step 2 (interpret the 'or' as an 'inclusive or')

2. $(r′,l′) = (5,5)$. $\rightarrow$  TRUE
 
As "1 or 2" is TRUE, the conditions hold, so (2, 20) is weakly preferred to  (5,5).

\

Next, is (5, 5) NOT weakly preferred to (2,20)? ... now let (5,5) be (r,l) and 2,20 be (r',l')

 

1. $r ≥ r′$ and $(r,l) \neq  (5,5)$ $\rightarrow$ FALSE ... because now (r,l) is (5,5) ... so go to the second condition... 
 
2. $(r′,l′) = (5,5)$. $\rightarrow$  FALSE 
 
So (5, 5) is NOT weakly preferred to (2,20).

 
 \
 
Thus, as we have th
... (2,20) weakly preferred to (5,5)
... (5,5) not weakly preferred to (2,20)
We thus have (2,20) strictly preferred to (5,5).
 
But note how the "and $(r,l) \neq (5,5)$" condition above was needed ... if it weren't there, we would have concluded a weak preference in both directions (implying indifference).

```



\

Try part B... here we consider whether this person's preferences can be represented by a utility function that is *additive* in the number of rooms and the floor.  I.e., a utility function that is the sum of two functions, one that is a function of the floor ($\ell$), and another that is a function of the number of rooms (r). For example $r^2 + exp(l)$ is the sum of the functions $f(r)=r^2$ and $g(\ell)= exp(\ell)$.

It turns out that it *cannot* be represented by a utility function that is additive in this way...

\


<!-- 
> B. Show that the individual’s preference relation cannot be represented by a function $u$ with $u(x) = f(r(x))+g(\ell(x))$

for functions $f$ and $g$, where $r(x)$ is the number of rooms and $\ell(x)$ is the floor for any unit $x$.

--> 

(Note that the given the $r$ and $\ell$ functions simply identify the number of rooms and the floor of a unit, they are not 'really' functions.)

Think about it, try it; we will discuss the answer in some detail.

<!--
```{block2,  type='fold'}

> If there is a utility representation of this form, then it satisfies [all of the following]

$$f (5) + g (12) > f (4) + g (20)$$ 
  
$$f (4) + g (5) > f (2) + g (12)$$
  
$$f (2) + g (20) > f (5) + g (5)$$
  
Can all of this be possible at the same time? How would you check this? (think, and then unfold below)
  
```
\

```{block2,  type='fold'}

If each of these three inequalities hold, then the *sum* of all the terms on the left of these must exceed the sum of all the terms on the right of these.

So add up the right and left sides: 
  
$$f (5) + g (12) + f (4) + g (5) + f (2) + g (20) > f (4) + g (20) + f (2) + g (12) f (5) + g (5) $$.

\

But look closely: the left and right sides are the same (just in a different order). If we cancel them out we get $0 >0$, a contradiction. This proves that if a utility function is to represent these preferences, is *cannot be additive in the two characteristics*.

\

We might have thought of this earlier: The characteristics of the 'preferred' apartments are the same, in total, as the characteristics of the less-preferred apartments. They are just combined in different ways. So the *ways they are combined* must matter to this utility function. It cannot simply add up a separate function of each characteristic. 

By the way, one reason I showed you this is because this 'add up the inequalities on both sides' check, for 'proof by contradiction' comes up a bit in simple proofs in microeconomics. (I have seen it, e.g., in the 'mechanism design/principle-agent' stuff).

I also think it is good to think about 'what sort of (utility) function can represent a particular relationship'. That should come up again in your work, study, and research. 

```

### Some easier exercises (from Varian's intermediate text)

i. What does it mean to say that a function, $u(x_1; x_2)$ represents a consumer’s preferences over bundles of $x_1$ and $x_2$?

```{block2,  type='fold'}

Answer: A utility function $u$ represents a consumer’s preferences, $\succsim$, over bundles X and Y , if $u(X) \geq u(Y)$ if and only if $X \succsim Y$. I.e. whenever bundle $X$ is (weakly) preferred to bundle $Y$, u assigns a higher number to $X$ than it does to $Y$ (and vice-versa)
,
```

\
ii.  What assumptions do we need to make so that preferences can be represented by a utility function?

```{block2,  type='fold'}

Answer: If the choice set is finite (i.e., it contains some finite number of bundles to choose from, e.g., 100 bundles) and preferences are complete, transitive, and reflexive, then there exists a utility function that can represent the consumer’s preferences.

\

If the choice set is infinite (e.g.,$\{x_1,x_2\} \in \mathbb{R^2_{+}}$) we also need to assume preferences are *[continuous](#continuity)*.
```


## Exercises: Choice {-#ex-choice}

Please be sure you can do all the 'comprehension questions' throughout section \@ref(choice) above. Note that some of O-R's  exercises for this are too mathematical for this module/for my taste.

\

### OR chapter 2 Exercise 6 "Caring up to a limit"


\

### OR chapter 2 Exercise 8 "Money pump"


\


### O-R ex. 2.3 

> The waiter informs him ... he may have either broiled salmon at 2.50 USD or steak at 4.00 USD. ... he elects the salmon. Soon after the waiter returns from the kitchen ... to  tell him that fried snails and frog’s legs are [also available] for 4.50 USD  each. ... his response is “Splendid, I’ll change my order to steak”.

Explain in your own words, and using the formal language of preferences and choices, why this seemingly perverse behavior *could* or *could not* be rationalizable. Does it depend on how we define the goods in the choice set?

This material is largely drawn from O-R Chapter 3, but I also consult a number of other sources as well as my own notes. You are advised to read most of this O-R chapter along with this web-book. But please see my [notes below](#unc-readings) on what you can skip.
```

<div class="marginnote">

Here we follow the order of O-R in covering preferences under uncertainty *before* consumer behavior and demand. Either ordering is possible, but the idea is to fully cover the 'primitives' of the model before considering it's implications.

## Introduction


Our previous discussion:  Choices with *known* consequences


`r format_with_col("But in the real world many important economic decisions involve uncertainty.","gray")`

<br> 

Here: Choices with *unknown* consequences (but known *probabilities* of each outcome)

<div class="marginnote">
Adv: In the real world, people may also make choices in contexts with unknown probabilities; this is called 'ambiguity' or 'Knightian uncertainty'. This is out of the scope of this module. (But this is the sort of extension that may motivate a good project).
</div>

How can we consider this in a choice (or utility-maximisation) framework?

The standard framework for this involves maximising 'expected utility'.


```{block2,  type='warning'}
Making choices to maximise expected utility is *not* the same as making choices to maximise expected monetary outcomes. This is one of the main points here.

Do not get this mixed up! You must understand this distinction to consider yourself an 'intermediate microeconomist' or better.

```


```{block2,  type='note'}

**Some summary notes**

Previously described utility functions: predict choices under certainty. They made no predictions for choices with uncertain probabilistic outcomes! In principle, we could allow any preferences over these 'lotteries', making no restrictions ... each lottery might be valued by an individual in *any way*. 

\

We will focus on the 'Expected utility' model of preferences.

True, people don't "maximise expected monetary value": they tend to be risk-averse.
n *Expected Utility* (EU) framework, as defined below, allows for risk-aversion or any other attitude towards risky *outcomes*. 

\

But EU *does* make some meaningful (and perhaps unrealistic) restrictions on preferences and choices, as the Allais paradox indicates.  

```

## Probability concepts and notation (including sums and integrals): a quick review

```{block2,  type='note'}

You must understand the logic and notation of probability to understand this (and much more material in your degree). If you already know this stuff, feel free to skip/skim.

```

Probability (informal definition)
:     The relative frequency with which an event occurs, or can be expected to occur.

- Always between 0 and 1


<div class="marginnote">

Note, there are some debates, e.g., between 'Bayesians' and 'Frequentists' over the meaning of probability.

</div>

<div class="inputq">
Q: If $p$ is the probability an event occurs, what is the probability this event does *not* occur?
</div>

```{block2,  type='fold'}
Ans: $1-p$

If you didn't find this obvious, I would suggest seriously revising simple probability, perhaps using the Khan academy materials.

```

\

<div class="marginnote">
Some of the discussion of these  probability basics comes from Anne Greenbaum Wash U notes)
</div>

### Discrete Random Variables

```{block2,  type='note'}

The O-R chapter on uncertainty considers only discrete 'lotteries' ... those with a finite number of prizes. However, outcomes described by continuous random variables will likely come up in other material, and these are extremely important for Finance, as well as for Econometrics and many other fields.

```

A discrete random variable $X$ takes on values $x_i$ with probability $p_i$,
$i=1, \ldots, m$, where $\sum_{i=1}^{m} p_i = 1$.


<div class="marginnote">
For example, the outcome of a lottery ticket that pays a prize of £100 with probability $\frac{1}{2}$, a prize of £10 with probability $\frac{1}{10}$, and nothing (£0) with the remaining $\frac{4}{10}$ ... can be naturally expressed as a discrete random variable.
</div>


<br> <br> \bigskip

The *expected value* (EV) of a discrete random variable $X$ is defined as

$$E(X) \equiv \langle X \rangle = \sum_{i=1}^m p_i x_i$$

...also called the *mean* of the random variable $X$, denoted as $\mu$.

\

`r format_with_col("Also see the 'variance' and other 'moments'.","gray")`

<br> <br> \bigskip


### Continuous Random Variables

A 'continuous random variable' takes on any of an infinite number of values within a range.

An example: the possible exact duration of rainfall (in hours, seconds, milliseconds....) to fall on Exeter in Summer 2025 is most naturally expressed as a continuous random variable.

<div class="marginnote">

If you are not familiar with this concept, you should try to understand it, at least for your studies in general; consult Khan academy and other tutorials. This is a very important concept but takes some time to fully comprehend.

</div>


If it has no 'mass points'then we can only express the probability of it falling *within* an interval.

"Mass points" explained (unfold)

```{block2,  type='fold'}
A "mass point" would describe a specific exact value of a continuous variable that occurs with a positive probability.

With rainfall and with most naturally occuring phenomena it is hard to imagine that this is possible.

But for 'measured rainfall' we might expect that there is a positive probability of 'zero measured rainfall'.

Perhaps in the context of income it's reasonable to expect substantial 'mass points' at round numbers … e.g., many people may earn exactly £50,000 per year.


```


\

*Cumulative distribution function*:

$$ F(x) \equiv \mbox{Prob}(X < x ),$$

This is essentially a function that specifies "the probability of random variable $X$ falling (at or) below some level x."

E.g., $F_r(103.4) =  \mbox{Prob}(X < 103.4 )$...

"the probability of 103.4 hours or fewer of rainfall ($X$) in Exeter for Summer 2025".


\


The *probability density function* (pdf).

$$ f (x)\,dx \equiv \mbox{Prob}( X \in [ x, x+\,dx ] ) = F(x+\,dx ) - F(x) .$$

\

This function is not really interpretable on its own. You might be tempted to read it as 'the probability of exactly a certain value, such as 'exactly 103.4 hours of rainfall', but this would be incorrect (unless we have mass points).  It is best thought of as the 'rate of change' of the CDF, as the limit of the difference in the CDF function for each small interval.

Letting $dx \rightarrow 0$:

$$ f (x) = F' (x) ,~~~F(x) = \int_{- \infty}^{x} f (t)\,dt .$$

\
The 'standard normal density function' is depicted below:
```{r}

curve(dnorm(x),
      xlim = c(-3.5, 3.5),
      ylab = "Density", 
      main = "Standard Normal Density Function") 

```

If a variable has this (or any) probability distribution, we can determine the probability that it falls in any particular region by computing the *area under the curve* between these regions, i.e., computing the integral between these regions. 

<div class="marginnote">
For some distributions, like the normal distribution or the uniform distribution, we can compute all of these 'analytically', i.e., we have a formula.  In other cases we will need to 'simulate' these through a process of drawing random numbers.
</div>
 
\

Below [(link here)](https://bookdown.org/machar1991/ITER/2-pt.html), a very useful review of probability theory that also shows you how to compute and plot these using the `R` language.

<div class="marginnote">
You don't need to learn how to compute these in `R` for this module, but it may aid your understanding, and may be helpful for your future work. 

This material is from the web version of 'Introduction to Econometrics with R', 
Christoph Hanck, Martin Arnold, Alexander Gerber and Martin Schmelzer
</div>
   
```{r}
knitr::include_url("https://bookdown.org/machar1991/ITER/2-1-random-variables-and-probability-distributions.html#probability-distributions-of-discrete-random-variables")
```



The expected value  (EV) of a continuous random variable $X$ is then defined by
$$ E(X) = \int_{- \infty}^{\infty} x f (x)\,dx .$$


<br> <br> \bigskip

Note that by definition, $\int_{- \infty}^{\infty} f (x)\,dx = 1$.


\

Expected value
:     The 'average outcome' of an uncertain variable (general definition)

<br> <br> \bigskip

:     The average monetary (or goods) payoff from an uncertain gamble

<br> <br> \bigskip

:     The sum of the value at each possible outcome, weighted by the probability that outcome will occur

```{block2,  type='technote'}

When outcomes are in a continuous space, e.g., the returns to a stock can take any of an infinite number of possible values, the expected value becomes a definite integral rather than a sum.

```

This is *NOT* the same as expected utility (coming up); people don't necessary choose the investment with the highest expected value!

## "Lotteries"

O-R, p. 31:

> An alternative in the set involves randomness regarding the consequence it yields. We refer to these alternatives as lotteries. For example, a raffle ticket that yields a car with probability 0.001 and nothing otherwise is a lottery. A vacation on which you will experience grey weather with probability 0.3 and sunshine with probability 0.7 can be thought of as a lottery as well.


\

### Formal definition of Lotteries (from O-R), explanation

</center>

<div class="marginnote">
In other texts you may see these  referred to as "simple gambles".
</div>



> Let $Z$ be a set (of prizes).

$Z$ could be a list of amounts, say $\{0,10,100\}$ or a list of bundles of goods, say {(nothing),(apple and carrot), (two carrots)}.


> A lottery over $Z$ is a function $p : Z \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$...
> that assigns a positive number (probability) $p(z)$ to a finite number of members of $Z$ and $0$ to all other members,

Simplifying this, the probability function $p$ 'tells you the probability of each outcome ($z$) among the set of possible outcomes ($Z$)' for this lottery.  

> with $\sum_{z \in Z} p(z) = 1$.

(Unfold for further explanation of this)
```{block2,  type='fold'}

The sum of the probabilities of each possible outcome must be 1... 'one of the possibilities must happen'.  (Note that this also implies that no individual probability can exceed 1, so $0 \leq p(z) 1$ for all 'possibilities' $z$.)

```

\

> We denote the set of all lotteries over $Z$ by $L(Z)$

(Unfold)
```{block2,  type='fold'}

For the example I give above, this means $L(Z)$ is 'any possible lottery with some  some probability of "apple and carrot", some probability of "two carrots", and (the remaining) probability of "nothing". Each of these probabilities could be anything between 0 and 1.

```

>  the lottery that yields the prize $z$ with probability 1 by [z]

<div class="marginnote">
$[z]$ represents a trivial case (sometimes called a 'degenerate' lottery). A 'certainty' is also a lottery, by this definition.
</div>


> and the lottery that yields the prize $z_k$ with probability $\alpha_k$ for $k = 1,..., K$

<div class="marginnote">
I.e., each prize $z_k$ occurs with probability  $\alpha_k$ ... so  $z_1$ occurs with probability  $\alpha_1$, etc.
</div>

> by $\alpha_1 \cdot z_1 \oplus \alpha_2\cdot z_2 \oplus ··· \oplus \alpha_K \cdot z_K$

\

This is a very handy notation but it needs some explanation (unfold).

```{block2,  type='fold'}

We are trying to concisely depict a lottery with K possible outcomes (where K can be any number). Each of these possibile outcomes is indicated by $z_1$, $z_2$, ... etc., all the way up to $z_K$.

Each of these possibities has some probability of occuring. We denote these possibilities by $\alpha_1$ for outcome $z_1$, $\alpha_2$ for outcome $z_2$, etc.

E.g., for a two-outcome lottery, rather than writing 'a lottery where outcome $z_1$ occurs with probability $\alpha_1$, $z_2$ occurs with probability $\alpha_2$, etc., we can simply write it as $\alpha_1 \cdot z_1 \oplus \alpha_2\cdot z_2$. Here the $\oplus$ means 'and also outcome...' and the $\cdot$ means 'with probability'.

```




```{block2,  type='inputq'}
How would you use this notation to depict "a lottery with a 1/3 probability of an outcome with value 10, and a 2/3 probability of an outcome with value 100"?
```

```{block2,  type='fold'}

$10 \cdot \frac{1}{3} \oplus 100\cdot \frac{2}{3}$

```

\

```{block2,  type='inputq'}

Consider the diagrams in figure 3.1 in O-R. Can you explain what the points depicted mean? Could you depict the lottery $\frac{3}{4} \cdot z_1 \oplus \frac{1}{4}\cdot z_2 \oplus 0\cdot z_3$ in a 3-D diagram similar to figure 3.1b? (by the way, this is called a 'probability simplex').

```

<div class="marginnote">
(Possible video here)
</div>
 

## Preferences over lotteries

We now have the tools consider the question that motivated this: how might an individual choose among a set of uncertain choices, and what can we say about this?

Formally, what are the "preferences over the set of lotteries $L(Z)$” and “what restrictions over these preferences seem reasonable”?


```{block2,  type='note'}

Please learn the precise definitions of these concepts from the O-R text, whether or not I spell them out here.
```  

<div class="marginnote">
DR Todo: I intend to add a video here discussing this... I want to convey why the 'Expected Utility framework' is not obvious.
</div>

\

O-R consider some 'examples' of preferences (or categories of preferences) over these lotteries that may seem rather extreme;

<div class="marginnote">

We might instead consider these as "simple decision rules" or "heuristics" rather than actual preferences. Behavioral economics considers that people may adopt such simplifying rules instead of maximizing perfectly in the complete set of alternatives, particularly because such maximization is mentally costly.

Of course it is doubtful that anyone completely has these preferences or follows these rules all the time. Still, it is instructive to consider what doing so would mean. It's worth reading these definitions carefully, and then we can consider how these diverge from the "expected utility" framework we will discuss in a moment.

</div>

- **Ex. 3.1 "A pessimist"**: Essentially, someone whose preferences among these lotteries simply depends on "which one has the worst possible outcome ($w(p)$) that is least bad". (Where 'worst' is according to some particular ranking... which can have any form.)

- **Ex 3.2 "good and bad"**: This person divides all possible outcomes into "good outcomes" and "bad outcomes" (in some particular way...there are many possibilities for doing this.)  They simply prefer the lottery which has the highest probability of a "good" outcome (or conversely the lowest probability of a bad outcome).

<div class="marginnote">
TODO: I intend to include a video here discussing the 'good and bad' preference. 
</div>



- **Ex 3.3 minimizing options**:  This person doesn't actually care about the content of any of the outcomes; they simpler prefer the lottery with the fewest possible outcomes.


<div class="marginnote">
This seems to me to be a sort of 'opposite extreme' to the pessimistic preference.  While the pessimist is extremely sensitive to the very worst thing, the "good and bad" person is insensitive to whether the "good things" are 'really good or just OK'  or whether  the bad things" are really bad or just a bit mediocre.
</div>

## Properties of preferences (over uncertainties) (O-R 3.2.1) {#prop-unc-pref}

<div class="marginnote">
These properties will justify EU preferences. If you like, you may want to jump down to [Expected utility](#expected-util) first, and come back here, or watch [this video](https://youtu.be/VjnOWik5nbU)
</div>
 

```{block2,  type='note'}

**Some notation: **

Lotteries $L(Z)$ involve possible outcomes drawn from the 'prize space' $Z$. E.g., a lottery could be a 0.25 chance of each of outcomes 0, 10, 100, and 1000, drawn from the 'prize space' $\mathbb{R}^{+}$, the space of positive real numbers.



$E(p)$ denotes (basically) the expected monetary value of the lottery.


O-R use brackets to denote a 'certain outcome', 

e.g., $[b]$ represents 'outcome $b$ occuring with probablity one.'

```  



<div class="marginnote">
TODO: I intend to include a video here going over the formal notation and understanding of  each of these properties.

**Continuity of VnM preferences** 

"Some probablistic mix of a great thing and a terrible thing will be as good as an OK thing"


```{block2,  type='note'}
Note that this is distinct from the continuity of preferences over certainties [defined in the previous section](#continuity) 
```  

```{block2,  type='def'}

More formally (from O-R): 
  
> For any set $Z$ of prizes, a preference relation $\succsim$ over $L(Z)$ is continuous if for
any three prizes a, b, and c in $Z$ such that $[a] \succ [b] \succ [c]$ there is a number
$\alpha$ with $0 < \alpha < 1$ such that $[b] \sim  \alpha \cdot a \oplus (1 − \alpha) \cdot c$. 

```  


\

```{r  fig.cap = '', out.height='20%', fig.asp=.4, fig.align='center',  echo = FALSE}
 knitr::include_graphics(file.path("picsfigs","continuity_scribble.png"))
```




- Counterexample: Pessimistic preferences are *not continuous* (counterexamples help illustrate the 'bite' of a property)

<div class="marginnote">
Note that this definition of continuity is remeniscent but not identical to the definition of continuity for preferences over certain outcomes, which you may have seen before, and which we will return to in the next chapter. One difference is that here we are not considering making a bundle that is itself similar to bundle $b$, but we are considering a probablistic conbination of two other bundles, a and b.
</div>
 


\

**Def: Compound lotteries**

- Important;  might be considered an 'algebra of finance'...
- a distributed format
- 'sum product of x across all lotteries $p_1...p_k$'

\

**Def: Independence**

"If I prefer a particular (certain) $A$ over a particular lottery $B$, I also prefer to increase the probability of A over B... in a 'compound lottery'"

- Counterexamples: pessimistic preferences, 'minimizing options'
- Note how, in this case, a property over $\succsim$ extends to $\succ$

<div class="marginnote">
Independence and pessimistic preferences are relevant to 'population ethics' and 'effective altruism' and 'other-regarding preferences', and 'social welfare functions/social preferences'. E.g., sometimes we must decide between 'making a big positive difference with a high probability' (e.g., providing bednets to prevent malaria) and 'making an extremely large positive difference with a very small probability' (e.g., building a system to block an asteroid from destroying the earth).

Further explanation ... why is this property called 'independence'?

**Def: Monotonicity of VnM preferences**

"A lottery (between two things) gets better as the better thing gets more likely"

- Independence implies monotonicity; this is a fairly easy and cool proof (check it out)


## Expected utility {#expected-util}

<center>
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/VjnOWik5nbU" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</center>

Expected Utility is the 'most commonly assumed' framework in economic theory. We will consider certain “axioms” that seem reasonable, particularly the ‘independence’ axiom. We can formally prove that "if people’s preferences obey these axioms, then their preferences must be 'consistent with expected utility'".

<div class="marginnote">
Again, this method...
- Define axioms that seem reasonable
- prove what this implies (in terms of 'maximizing behavior')
...
is sometimes called "normative Economics".  But this is confusing as "normative" is also used to refer to several other things. I hate that word!

</div>


```{block2,  type='tip'}

For a more intuitive, less formal characterisation of Expected Utility, i.e., the 'the von Neumann-Morgenstern utility function', [please see the McDL text on this.](https://saylordotorg.github.io/text_introduction-to-economic-analysis/s14-04-risk-aversion.html)

```  

However, Expected Utility preferences (choices) rules out some stated preferences (and choices) that seem common. We will see this in the [“Allais Paradox”](#allais), for example.


\

**Under this framework**

When evaluating alternatives (or, if optimising, when making choices) involving uncertainty, she does **not** (necessarily) maximise expected monetary value.

Instead, she maximises 'Expected Utility' (EU): the sum of her (VNM) valuations '$v(\cdot)$' under each outcome weighted by the *probability* of each outcome. (O-R refer to this as the *Bernoulli function*.) 

<div class="marginnote">

I use the $v(\cdot)$ function notation rather than $u(\cdot)$ to differentiate the utility over a lottery in the EU framework ($U$) from the utility of one possible outcome of that lottery ($v$). However, in the EU framework we see that that the EU of a 'degenerate lottery' containing  outcome $z$ with probability 1 is simply $U(p) = p_z \times v(z) = 1 \times v(z)$.

</div>
 


... I.e., she chooses to maximise the value of her $v(z)$ function under each outcome $z$ weighted by the probability of each outcome $p_z$.

<div class="marginnote">

While I describe a set of countable alternatives, O-R define the below over the more general idea of a 'set of lotteries $L(Z)$ over prizes $Z$'.

</div>

\

```{block2,  type='def'}

**Definitions:**
  
Remember, each lottery $p$ is a set of probabilities over each possible alternative. With a finite set of $n$ alternatives $z_1, z_2, ...,z_n$ we have probabilities $p_1, p_2, ..., p_n$ over each.

Consider the "Expected Utility" function $U$. This has a particular form. It is defined over each lottery $p$ as:

$$U(p)= \sum_{i=1}^{n}p_i v(z_i)$$.

Where $v(\cdot)$ is a 'value function' (aka 'sub-utility function', aka 'Bernoulli function').

\

If an individual's preferences (choices) are 'consistent with this',

- so she always prefers (chooses) the lottery with the highest value of the above sum,

- for some specific $v$ function (which is the same $v$ function across lotteries, of course),

... then we say she has 'Expected utility' ('EU', or von-Neumann Morganstern) preferences (if she *chooses* according to these preferences, she is an 'EU maximizer').

```

\

Note that the above does not specify *what* the $v$ function must be. Obviously this may differ across individuals.

\

When we dealt with certainties, utility was 'ordinal'. All we could say or know is whether “A yielded more utility than B or vice versa”.

However, if we assume EU preferences and focus on the $v$ function, now the *magnitude* of the difference matters. Furthermore, it is now meaningful to consider the "curvature" of this $v$ function in a single good which we could just call ‘wealth’.


\

*Unfold for a further discussion of this; which may make more sense after reading further*

```{block2,  type='fold'}

With uncertainty, linear (affine) transformations of the $v$ function represent the same preferences and thus lead to the same behaviour; nonlinear monotonic transformations may not.

\

Formally, if the VNM utility function $v(\cdot)$ represents a set of preferences, the VNM utility function $w(\cdot)$ represents the same preferences if and only if, for some scalar $\alpha$ and some scalar $\beta>0$

$$w(g) = \alpha + \beta v(g).$$

\
Note that when we were choosing between two goods under certainty,
the *level* of total utility didn't really matter, only the relative utilities. Now that we are considering gambles, the overall utility level matters, because we need to consider the extent of the tradeoff between 'rich and poor' states.

```

\

By varying the $v(\cdot)$ function we can vary what we will define as  the '[risk preference](#risk-pref)'; ...Risk-loving, risk neutral, and risk averse individuals can all be seen as maximizing EU, as discussed [below](#eu-risk).


```{block2,  type='tip'}

Although O-R cover the Allais paradox next, I think it may be easier to understand after considering EU and risk preferences. Thus I consider it [further down](#allais) and again when we consider behavioral economics, time permitting. 
```  

\

## Risk preferences {#risk-pref}

 
Consider the choice between two gambles and one 'certainty':

1. Earn £1,000,000 with probability 0.1 \& zero with prob. 0.9
2. Earn £100,000 with probability 1/2 \& £50,000 with prob. 1/2
3. Earn £75,000 for certain

<br>  \bigskip

```{block2,  type='inputq'}

Consider: which do you think you would choose? What would you predict others will choose, and why? Are any of these 'clearly better' than any other?
```

\

The decision among such lotteries depends on an individual's preferences, in particular, her 'risk preferences'. We divide up the space of possible preferences with the following definitions...

\


**Definitions (loose):**

1. Risk Neutrality: a *Risk-neutral* person always chooses the option with the highest *expected monetary value*

<div class="marginnote">
Expected monetary value: the probability-weighted sum of the monetary outcomes. E.g., above, choice 2 as an expected monetary value of £100,000 $\times \frac{1}{2}$ +  £50,000  $\times \frac{1}{2} = $ £75,000.
</div>

```{block2,  type='inputq'}

Consider: what sort of $v$ function, a function of monetary income, would have the property that

.... it implies that the expected utility (the probability-weighted sum of the $v$ terms) of a  gamble is always higher when the expected monetary value of this gamble is higher?

```

```{block2,  type='fold'}

Answer: Such a $v$ function must be linear (or affine);

it must take the form $v(y)= a + by$ for some $b>0$.

Can you prove this?
```


\


<br>

2. Risk-Averse: a *risk-averse* person will always prefer a 'sure thing' over a 'gamble with the same expected monetary value'

- She will always prefer gambles with less risk, holding the expected value constant
- She will always reject 'fair gambles' (see below) and prefer certainties
- To accept a (fair) gamble, she must expect a 'risk-premium'

\
<!---
```{r  fig.cap = '', out.width='70%', fig.asp=.4, fig.align='center',  echo = FALSE}
 knitr::include_graphics(file.path("picsfigs","weirdalscissors.jpg"))
```
-->


3. A *Risk-lover* will always choose fair gambles over certainties, and sometimes choose a gamble that is unfair against her.

\

```{block2,  type='def'}

**Formal definitions of risk preferences from O-R** (emphasis added):
  
Recall that lotteries $L(Z)$ involve possible outcomes drawn from the 'prize space' of positive real numbers. E.g., a lottery could be a 0.25 chance of each of outcomes 0, 10, 100, and 1000.
  
> If $Z = \mathbb{R}^{+}$ 
> a preference relation  on the set $L(Z)$ of lotteries over $Z$ 
> is **risk-averse** if $[E(p)] \succsim p$ for every lottery $p \in L(Z)$

Recall  '$[E(p)]$' denotes (basically) the expected monetary value of the lottery occuring with probability 1, a weighted sum or integral, formally $E(p) = \sum_{z \in Z} p(z)z$ 
<div class="marginnote">
Of course it doesn't have to be 'monetary value' ... it could equivalently be a measure of the size of a bundle of goods.
</div>
 

So this defines *risk averse* as 'weakly preferring a certainty to a lottery with the same expected monetary value'  

  
>  is **strictly risk-averse** if $[E(p)] \succ p$ for every lottery $p \i L(Z)$ that involves more than one prize, 

> and is **risk-neutral** if $[E(p)] \sim p$ for every lottery $p \in L(Z)$, 
  
```

### Risk preferences and EU {-#eu-risk}

Imagine the realised utility $v(y)$ that arises from the consumption chosen with wealth $y$. H$.
ere we will express this as the (similar concept) 'indirect utility function' $V(y)

<div class="marginnote">

This is referred to as a 'indirect utility function', and sometimes written in capitals as $V(y)$: an indirect utility function maps the utility that can be attained (assuming optimal choices) as we shift an individual's wealth (and prices).

TODO: link notes on this

</div>

- This should be increasing (because of nonsatiation, 'more preferred to less'), thus (assuming differentiability) $V^\prime (y)>0$

- But it may increase at a *decreasing* rate, implying $V^{\prime \prime}(y)< 0$

This second assumption, called *diminishing marginal utility*,  will imply 'risk aversion'! (This is a 'sufficient condition').

If the person is 'risk-neutral', it must be linear, thus $V(y) = a + by$, thus $V^{\prime \prime}(y)=0$

<br>


### Risk attitude: O-R formal depiction {#risk-attitude-formal}
  
Assume a 'set of prizes $Z$' that are (nonnegative) real numbers .. think of each prize $z \in Z$  as some monetary reward.

> We denote the expected value of any lottery $p$ by $E(p) = \sum_{z∈supp(Z)} p(z)z$ 

This adds up every monetary prize in the 'support of Z' (i.e., those that occur with positive probability), weighted by their respective probabilities.  


<div class="marginnote">
(Above quote is from O-R, page 40) If we have a continuum of prizes with some probability, we will depict this using a probability density function and the above will be expressed as a definite integral.)
</div>
 
 
```{block2,  type='def'}

**O-R Definition 3.6: Risk aversion and risk neutrality** 
  
> If $Z = \mathbb{R_+}$, ...

*(real 'money' prizes)*

> ... a preference relation $\succsim$ on the set $L(Z)$ of lotteries over Z 

> is **risk-averse** if $[E(p)] \succsim p$ for every lottery $p \in L(Z)$,

*(if the expected value of the certainty of a lottery is 'at least as good as' each lottery)*


> is strictly risk-averse if $[E(p)] \succ p$ for every lottery $p \in L(Z)$ that involves more than one
prize, ...

*(note the change to the $\succ$ strict preference operator)*

> and is risk-neutral if $[E(p)] \sim p$ for every lottery $p \in L(Z)$ ...

```  
 
\
O-R next state, and show, that **risk-aversion is equivalent to the concavity of the Bernoulli function $v$**. The proof follows from a general math identity known as Jensen's inequality, which essentially states that for concave functions 'the function of the average of two arguments' always exceeds 'the average of the function of two arguments'. 

<div class="marginnote">
This is easy to see for a graph with a single argument ... connect two points on the 'ceiling of a cave or a dome' and note that the string connecting the two points is always below the ceiling. 

</div>

*Note that for smoothly differentiable functions (those with a second derivative) concavity is equivalent to a second derivative that is zero or negative*. 
 
\


```{block2,  type='tip'}

For a very simple explanation of the relationship between the concavity of  the utility function and risk preference, and a discussion of 'why people buy insurance' ... see any of the many videos online, like [this one by Ronald Moy.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCreeXzCNRc)

```  


<br> 

### Further intuition and discussion {-}

Coming back to the choice between two gambles and one 'certainty':

1. $Y_1$: £1,000,000 with probability 0.1 and zero with prob. 0.9
2. $Y_2$: £100,000 with probability 0.5 and £50,000 with prob. 0.5
3. $Y_3$: £75,000 for certain

\



Considering each *outcome* from any of these...

we know $u(1,000,000) > u(100,000) > u(75,000)> u(50,000) > u(0)$...

but now the *size of the difference* in these utilities matters for your decision!


<br> 

- Consider Y1 vs Y3: Is 1 million 'more than ten times as good (utility-wise) as 75k?'

- Y2 v Y3: Relative to 75k, does an additional 25k yield a utility gain worth the (equally probable) loss of 25k?

\


**Illustration:** Why the 'size of the difference in u(y) matters' when dealing with uncertainty.

Suppose there is Open Enrollment in Oxford, Bristol, Plymouth.

$\rightarrow$ Here I only need to know the *ranking* of utilities of each to know your choices.

- If you choose Oxford over Bristol, even though Oxford costs more, I can infer that for you $u(Oxford)>u(Bristol)$

<br> 

Now, in contrast suppose there is a "Lottery policy", which is:

> A. Rank Oxford over Bristol and you have a 25\% chance of getting into either, and a 50\% chance of Plymouth.

> B. Rank Bristol highest and you have a 100\% chance of getting into Bristol.

\


```{block2,  type='inputq'}

Now, suppose that I know that your preferences are  Oxford $\succ$ Bristol $\succ$ Plymouth.

Do I now know whether you will choose A or B? What would it depend on?

```  

\

```{block2,  type='fold'}

No. I don't know if you will choose A or B; I would need to know the *strength* of your preferences.

```


<br> 

```{block2,  type='inputq'}

So, which tells me more about your preferences: your choices under Open Enrollment or your choices under the Lottery policy?
  
```  

```{block2,  type='fold'}

Your choices under the Lottery policy can be more informative. 

\

If I observe that you choose 'option A' under the Lottery policy I have learned *more* about your utility than I learned under Open Enrollment.

I have learned that your preference for Oxford over Bristol is  "stronger" than your preference for Bristol over Plymouth.

```


### Intuition for 'risk aversion iff concave value function $v(\cdot)$' {-#ra_concave}

Risk aversion is defined (at least one definition) as being unwilling to take any "fair gambles" (gambles with an expected monetary value of zero) not even small ones.  A risk averse person would never be willing to take on an equal probability of gaining a certain amount and losing that same amount.  If they are "globally risk-averse" this holds no matter what level of income/wealth they start at, and no matter how large or small this amount is.

\

If the value function is strictly concave that means it is 'everywhere increasing at a decreasing rate'.  This means that, starting from a single point the rate of increase above this point is always lower than the rate of decrease below this point.  A small loss is always at least somewhat more costly than a small gain of an equal monetary value. 

\

Thus a risk-averse person would reject such gambles.

\

### Graphical illustration of "risk aversion $\leftrightarrow$ the value function $v(\cdot)$ is concave" {-#concave}

\
```{r  fig.cap = '', out.width='70%', fig.asp=.4, fig.align='center',  echo = FALSE}

 knitr::include_graphics("picsfigs/risk_averse_eu_mcdl.png")

```




**How to illustrate this:**

<div class="marginnote">
TODO: I hope to include a video here 
</div>

- Show: $EU(gamble) = (1-p)u(x_{low}) + pu(x_{high}) < u(EV(x)) = u((1-p)x_{low} + px_{high})$

Draw a diagonal line between $u(x_{low})$ and $u(x_{high})$; the Expected Utility is in between these.

To find this expected utility: 

1. Go horizontal distance $p$ of the way between $x_{low}$ and $x_{high}$
2. Project up to the diagonal for the 'average of functions (EU)'

<div class="marginnote">

This is a mathematical/graphical property we can easily prove.

Intuition: The slope of a line tells me 'rise for a given run', the 'expectation' calculation is a linear function, so the slope is constant
and the 'share of the rise' simply projects up from the 'share of the run'
</div>
 

- Compare this to the vertical height of utililty function at same point $(1-p)x_{low} + px_{high}$

\


The result that the EV of the gamble is less than the EV of the certainty is actually a special case of *Jensen's inequality* (unfold if you are interested )

```{block2,  type='fold'}

For a strictly concave function $f(\cdot)$ and for constant $t \in [0,1]$

$$f(tx_1+(1-t)x_2) > tf(x_1)+(1-t)f(x_2)$$ ...

extended to expected values for a random variable $X$ ...

$$f(E(X)) > E(f(X))$$

## Allais paradox; considering other (non-EU) frameworks {#allais}

<!-- #TODO (Content to be added here, drawing both from O-R and from my previous notes) -->


### Simple depiction of Allais paradox {-}

Consider: 

**Scenario 2. Which would you choose?**

- Gamble A: an 89\% chance of winning £1 million, a 10\% chance of winning £5 million, and a 1\% chance of winning nothing.
- Gamble B: £1 million with certainty.

\

```{block2,  type='inputq'}

Write down (in Hypothesis): which would you choose?

```  

<!--#TODO: add a survey link -->


\hrulefill

\

**Scenario 2. Which would you choose?**

- Gamble C: an 89\% chance of winning nothing and an 11\% chance of winning £ 1 million.
- Gamble D: a 90\% chance of winning nothing and a 10\% chance of winning £5 million.

\


```{block2,  type='inputq'}

Write down (in Hypothesis): which would you choose?

```  

\

Many people choose B over A and choose D over C. But look what this implies!!:

$$B \succ A $$

$$ £ 1m \cdot 1\succ  £ 1m \cdot 0.89 \oplus £ 5m \cdot 0.1 \oplus £0 \cdot 0.01$$

\

At the same time...

$$D \succ C $$

$$(£ 0 \cdot 0.9 \oplus  £ 5m \cdot 0.10) \succ (£ 0 \cdot 0.89 \oplus £ 1m \cdot 0.11) $$

i.e.,

$$ £ 1m \succ  (£ 1m \cdot 0.89 \oplus £ 5m \cdot 0.1 \oplus £0 \cdot 0.01)$$
\



*But this contradicts Expected Utility maximization:*

If $B \succ A$ then $EU(A) > EU(B)$

- $\rightarrow u(1m) > 0.89 \: u(1m) + 0.1 \: u(5m) + 0.01 \: u(0)$
- $\rightarrow$ $0.11 \: u(1m) >  0.1 u(5m) + 0.01 \: u(0)$

\

Yet if $D \succ C$ then $EU(D)>EU(C)$

- $\rightarrow 0.9 \: u(0) + 0.1 u(5m) > 0.89 \: u(0) + 0.11 \: u(1m)$
- Implying $0.1 \: u(5m) + 0.01 \: u(0) > 0.11 \: u(1m)$
- Contradicting the above!

\


*More intuitively, note there is a 'reversal':*

In choosing B over A you gave up a 10\% chance of £5000 to get a 1\% greater chance of £1000 \
... but in choosing D over C you gave up a 1\% greater chance of £1000 to get a 10\% change of £5000



For EU mazimization it shouldn't matter that 'for the remaining 89\% of the time A differs from C'.... (unfold)

```{block2,  type='fold'}

This is an 'independent state of the world'; it should have no impact on your decisions for the remaining 11\% of the time.  Remember the 'independence property'?

By this logic, the fact that there is a 10\% chance that a meteor destroys England on Friday should not affect my choice \

of whether to go to a fancy restaurant or get a simple curry on Friday in the 90\% probability case that England is *not* hit.

```

\

**Explaining it again with pie charts...**

```{r  fig.cap = '', out.width='85%', fig.asp=.4, fig.align='center',  echo = FALSE}
 knitr::include_graphics(file.path("picsfigs", "allaispies.png"))
```

\

A is D plus an additional  89\% chance of £1m


B is C plus an additional 89\% chance of £1m


So "A and B" are "D and C" with **additional 89\% chance of £ 1m**


\

EU is *additive*: $\rightarrow$: \footnotesize{choice for *remaining* 11\% state ignores **difference**

By the EU calculation I make choices over which I prefer for the (remaining)
 11% of the time without considering what happens 89% of the time. 'Independent states of the world'.

\



**SO WHY do people choose B over A and D over C?**

One theory: People may maximize something like EU but they get the probabilities wrong.  They overweight small probabilities.

- $\rightarrow$  Gamble A: the 1\% chance of 0 is treated as larger?

\

```{block2,  type='note'}

Another theory: 

People do *not* choose in a way that could be characterised as maximizing the probability-weighted sum of a value function over outcomes. They do not do anything that could be depicted as EU maximization. Instead, the assess gambles using other criteria, perhaps framing 'reference points', and 'gains and losses' relative to this reference point. We will (time permitting) return to this in our discussion of 'prospect theory' when we consider Behavioral Economics. 

```  


\

## Experimental measures of risk attitudes {#exp-risk}

Economists try to measure people's level of risk aversion in various ways.

We try to measure 'revealed preferences' from real-world choices. E.g., what premium are people willing to pay to buy insurance for various things,  how much premium do they demand for taking on risky investments (with the same expected monetary values), and how much more do they have to be paid (on average) in jobs with variable compensation?

<br> 

We also run *experiments* with real or hypothetical payoffs to measure this.


<div class="marginnote">

Although it is widely used, the validity of the Holt and Laury method is disputed, and there are alternatives.

**However**, although it has been the most widely used procedure, the Holt and Laury task has been widely criticized, both on theoretical and empirical grounds. There are a variety of proposed  risk elicitation methods, as explored by @crosettoTheoreticalExperimentalAppraisal2016 and @charnessExperimentalMethodsEliciting2013.

It is not clear whether these 'do a good job'. According to [Charness et al, 2020](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11166-020-09325-6) [@charnessMeasuresRiskAttitude2020].


>...  these measures have some predictive power on behavior in experimental settings, and ... the most complex procedure (TCN) is outperformed by simpler procedures. Finally, we find no correlation between field behavior and measures of risk attitude. This finding is confirmed for all of the implemented measures, either simple or complex.

However, the Charness et al 'correlation' results appear largely underpowered.  

Other work finds that simple survey measures do a better job of predicting real world risk-taking behavior [@beauchampPsychometricEmpiricalProperties2017; @lonnqvistMeasuringIndividualRisk2015].

- How does this affect (financial, investment, insurance) choices?  Why does 'diversification improve outcomes for the risk-averse'?

#### Illustration: Binomial distribution {-}

- Suppose I have £ 1000, and I can bet on fair coin flips. My returns will then have what we call a “binomial distribution”.

\

Consider an illustration of binomial distributions

- If I bet all £ 1000 in a single flip, there is a 50\% chance I will lose my entire investment.
- If I bet £ 500 on two flips, there is only a 25% chance I will lose my entire investment (also reduces chance of doubling by 25\%).
    - The expected value is the same (0); thus this is better if you are risk averse.


<!--#TODO: put in a shiny example here illustrating this -->

"Less risky": B and A overlap with 0.5 probability; the remaining 50\% of time A's outcomes are more extreme. So it is less risky in a very general sense.

- If I bet £ 100 each in ten flips,  there is a 38\% chance that I will lose 20\% or more of my investment.
- If instead, I bet it on 1000 coin flips, betting £ 1 on each, there is only 6.00\% chance I will lose 5% of my investment or more, and only 1/10th of 1\% chance that I will lose 10\% of my investment or more.

\

You can check this, e.g., [here](https://shiny.rit.albany.edu/stat/binomial/)

```{r knitrapp}
knitr::include_app("https://shiny.rit.albany.edu/stat/binomial/",
height = "600px")
```

<br> 

*Result*: The more I can do this “diversification”, the less risk I face.

<br> 


*Note*: For simplicity, these examples have a 'fair coin flip', zero expected-return investment.


\

But you might be wondering: 'why invest at all? 


```{block2,  type='fold'}

Answer: Because this principle also applies to 'unfair coin flips'.


\

E.g., investments in the stock market are more profitable on average than money under the mattress

Each £1 invested in shares has a higher expected return, but also a higher risk.
 However by spreading across *many different* assets we can reduce this risk, as seen above, maintaining the same expected returns.

```

People may have  different preferences for risk versus *expected* (average) return. ('Risk' is the overall variance around the average.)

The above assumes 'optimal diversification': no one chooses points *below* the market line.

\

#### Extension: "Capital asset pricing model" (CAPM) {-}



<!-- #TODO (*More content/reading to be added here.*) -->

This is the  leading 'baseline' model in finance.

It assumes (or in fact, derives that) investors optimally diversify.


```{block2,  type='note'}

Holding the expected value of dividends constant, assets with higher market risk are less desirable, thus priced lower, and get higher returns

- Typical boring economist's investment advice: diversify to mimic the 'market basket', choose funds with low fees

This doesn't make you a hit at parties :(.
                                         
```  


\

Thus assets are priced based only on 'risk that cannot be diversified away from', which is called 'market risk'. The correlation between an asset's return and the return of the 'market basket optly diverse portfolio is sometimes called the asset's 'beta'.

\

Holding the expected value of dividends constant, assets with higher market risk are less desirable, thus they are priced lower, and they gain higher returns.

The trade-off between this risk and return has a linear relationship, i.e., the ('security market line')[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Security_market_line] has a constant slope.

```{block2,  type='inputq'}

Why, according to this model, is there a 'return to market risk' that is constant across all assets? The answer has to do with leveraging or de-leveraging using a 'risk free asset', and arbitrage.  See my hypothes.is comment [here](https://hyp.is/SxyAqBhMEeue-se-RO6R_w/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Security_market_line)

```  

<div class="marginnote">
Confusing matters further, in some discussions, the slope of the returns in the the market risk is referred depicted as a coefficient $\beta$.

You will also hear "Alpha" referred to, representing the intercept and and to depict the excess return of an asset over and above what would be predicted by its market risk.  People who claim to be able to beat the markets will flex about their ‘high Alpha’. But maybe they are just lucky.

### 'Certainty equivalent' of a gamble, 'Risk premium' {#ce-risk-premia}

From [McDL](https://saylordotorg.github.io/text_introduction-to-economic-analysis/s14-04-risk-aversion.html#mcafee-ch13_s04_f01)

> The **certainty equivalent** is an amount of money that provides equal utility to the random payoff of the gamble. The certainty equivalent is labeled CE in the figure. Note that CE is less than the expected outcome, if the person is risk averse.




```{r  fig.cap = 'Diagram rom McDL', out.width='55%', fig.asp=.4, fig.align='center',  echo = FALSE}

 knitr::include_graphics("picsfigs/risk_averse_eu_mcdl.png")

```


> The **risk premium** is defined to be the difference between the expected payoff (this is expressed as $\pi x_1 + (1 – \pi)x_2 in the figure) and the certainty equivalent.

> ... the amount of money an individual would be willing to pay to avoid [this particular] risk. 

Of course the risk premium needs to be expressed as a function of a particular gamble ... a larger amount at risk will presumably demand a higher premium from a risk-adverse person. 

But consider the amount you would need to pay an extremely poor person to be willing  take a coin-flip gamble over winning/losing £100. Now consider the amount you would need to pay a University Vice-Chancellor to take this risk. Would these amounts be the same? I.e,. as McDL ask:


> How does the risk premium of a given gamble change when the base wealth is increased? 

We might imagine think the risk premium (for any particular gamble) would fall as wealth increases. This depends on a particular condition on the curvature of the value function:

> It can be shown that the risk premium falls as wealth increases for any gamble, if and only if $−v''(x)/v′(x)$ is decreasing [in $x$].


```{block2,  type='warning'}

It looks like some of the equations in the McDL text did not render properly, at least not in the html version. Be careful with this! If you are in doubt, please doublecheck, e.g., with [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_aversion)
  
```  

\

**My attempt at intuition.** Note that the value function is always assumed to be increasing in $x$, essentially monotonicity. Thus $v'(x)$ >0$ at all points.

\

For a risk averse person (someone who is 'everywhere risk averse') this rate of increase, this 'marginal utility of income in a particular state', is decreasing in income. Thus each additional unit of income yields less and less additional value. Thus, as $v'(x)$ is decrease in $x$ we know $v''(x)$ is negative. 

\

So what about the negative of ratio $−v''(x)/v′(x)$ ... the negative sign up front makes it positive -- this is just to make it a simpler intuitive measure of 'more risk aversion'.  But what does it mean? Well, what will a risk premium depend on? 

1.  The 'price' of additional value at point $x$ depends on the marginal value of income, $v′(x)$. If I need to be 'given more utility to make up for the cost of taking on a small risk', this required payment (in income) will depend on $v′(x)$ at this point. This is in the denominator as it's a 'price per unit of value'.

2. The 'cost' of taking on a small risk at a certain point $x$ is that the value benefit of winning a small amount $\epsilon$ (from increasing your income past this point) is less than the cost of losing this $\epsilon$ amount. The difference in these depends on 'how much shallower $v(x)$ gets', i.e., 'how much does $v'(x)$ change' as I increase income a tiny bit from point $x$. But this difference  is precisely $v''(x)$. 

So perhaps we can think of the above ratio as the 'cost of taking on $\epsilon$ risk'---the numerator, as measured in units of the 'price of additional value ... (needed to compensate this)'--- the denominator. 

If the utility of taking on additional $\epsilon$ risk, as measured in terms of the price of compensating price this utility loss, is decreasing in wealth, then wealthier people will demand a smaller risk premium for the same small bet.

\

Anyways, this ratio is also referred to as the (Arrow-Pratt) 'coefficient of *absolute* risk aversion'.


### Local measures of risk-aversion {-#cara-crra}

- Coefficient of *absolute* risk aversion in income or weath $m$: $A(m) \equiv -\frac{u''(m)}{u'(m)}$

Note this is 'preserved under an affine transformation'; it is only affected by things that affect *preferences* (see indifference curves), not by 'the same preferences represented by a different utility function'. 

Note that the value of this measure itself may be constant, decreasing, increasing in income...


\

I say 'local' because these measures need not be constant. However, using differential equations we can derive a 'constant absolute risk aversion' utility function, also known as 'Exponential utility'

$$u(m) = 1 - exp(-\alpha m)$$
\


This 'CARA' utility is convenient for constructing and solving models, as we don't need to consider how risk preferences (and choices people are willing to make) changes with higher or lower wealth (perhaps as a consequence of policies). However, I suspect most people would not find it realistic.  McDL report:

> An important aspect of CARA with normally distributed risks is that the
preferences of the consumer are linear in the mean of the gamble and the
variance. Such preferences are often  called mean variance preferences, and they describe people who value risk linearly with the expected return. Such preferences comprise the foundation of modern finance theory

<br> 

Perhaps a more informative measure pertains to the willingness to take risks as a *share of one's income*: 

- Coefficient of *relative* risk aversion: $$R(m) \equiv mA(m)=-\frac{mu''(m)}{u'(m)}$$


This also need not be constant in income, although it seems more plausible to assume that it is. It is only constant if utility is of the 'isoelastic' form

$$u(w) = \frac{m^{1- \rho} - 1}{1-\rho}$$ 

... Note that *for the above utility function* $R(m) = \rho$ (and this it is constant).

<div class="marginnote">
Note that these ideas are also relevant to intertemporal substitution and to social welfare functions. The way we depict utility and preferences over time is similar to the way we depict preferences over uncertainty. This sometimes makes it hard to separate the two in empirical studies and applied questions.
</div>
 
\

**For these measures** 

RRA (ARA) constant $\rightarrow$ constant fraction of portfolio (number of dollars) held in risky asset as wealth increases.

\


These measures are discussed very neatly in the video below, giving some specific parametric examples.  However, he never explains exactly what the 'units' here are. What exactly do $A(W)$ and $R(W)$ measure?

### 'Prudence'  {-}

```{block2,  type='inputq'}

Does 'risk aversion' imply that it will be beneficial to lay aside more savings if you are facing greater risk, i.e., outcomes with greater variance? Why or why not?
  
```  


```{block2,  type='fold'}

Surprisingly, it does not imply this; it can go either way. Why? 
  
Consider the case with two state of the world, "good and bad". Imagine each occur with some probability, perhaps $\frac{1}{2}$.

Consider two people, Sam and Rick, with the same expected value income of 50 'next year'. Suppose both have the exact same risk-averse utility function.  

However, Rick faces a much greater variance of income than Sam. Suppose Rick gets income 10 half the time and 90 half the time, while Sam gets 40 half the time and 60 half the time. 

Now suppose each is considering how much of "this year's" income to lay aside for next year, at the cost of less pleasure this year. (I may not have covered utility across time and discounting yet, but I think you will get the idea.)

Who will find it more important to put aside money, Sam or Rick? ... think and unfold. 

```

```{block2,  type='fold'}

The answer:  not enough information to say either way.

With  diminishing returns to income (each year)...

- For the 50% 'bad state of the world' (where they have a lower income), the additional savings is more valuable to Rick than to Sam, as increasing from 10 to 11 (say) yields more utility gain than increasing from 40 to 41.
 
- However, for the 50% 'good' state of the world, the additional savings is *less* valuable to Rick than to Sam, as an increase from 90 to 91 is worth *less* utility than an increase from 60 to 61. 

So we don't know without more information about their value functions.

```


\


Economists have a particular definition of something called "Prudence". 

<div class="marginnote">

This is something economists do. We take a normal word and we define it with a particular mathematical meaning that may or may not agree with most people's common sense of that word is.

</div>

We define someone as *prudent* if they are risk-averse *and* if $v'''(y)<0$.  That's right, even the *third derivative* matters, and has an interpretation!

\

Prudence implies that risk is less painful at higher incomes. This implies that I will *save more* when facing greater risk. 

\

That might seem the obvious choice to you, in spite of the above discussion. If so, congratulations on knowing the sign of the third derivative of your value function!


\

### Food for thought: risk preferences across domains {-}


**Risk aversion over 'other-regarding preferences',  social outcomes, and 'my own impact'**

> If you think, “I’m risk-averse with respect to the difference that I make, so I really want to be certain that I, in fact, make a difference to how well the world goes,” then it’s going to be a really bad idea by your lights to work on extinction risk mitigation, because either humanity is going to go extinct prematurely or it isn’t. What’s the chance that your contribution to the mitigation effort turns out to tip the balance? Well, it’s minuscule.

## Time preferences and discounting {#time-pref}

(To be added, partly from McDL: 13.3 on ‘dynamic choice’)

Economists often consider preferences over time using nearly the same framework that they use for considering preferences over uncertainty. 

We 'sum a sequence of weighted payoffs' in both cases ... for uncertainty we weight by probability... 

For time-preferences we (might) consider 'discounting' future payoffs. 

(*Some discussion: (when) should we 'discount future payoffs'?*)

```{block2,  type='fold'}

**Individuals might discount future “pleasure”:**

because they might not survive to the future (although this should enter in as a ‘survival discount’ tied to the probability of surviving)

because they are impatient (but this is potentially not in their own interest).

But other than this, it is not entirely clear why this discounting makes sense. Why should I value 'a unit of utility' in the future less than a unit today? 

\


Discounting future *income* is much more reasonable, and 
**Individuals may discount future ‘income’ (in currency, inflation-adjusted) or ‘physical consumption’** 

If we think the ‘future me’ will be wealthier than the present me (consumption smoothing),

Or if we think I will be less sensitive to pleasure/pain.

```

Suppose an individual has concave payoffs (utility), perhaps a slope of the value function $v(x)$ (aka the 'utility of income' function) with a positive first derivative and a negative second derivative. They are 'risk averse' as defined above.

\
**Risk**:
*If there are two possible state of the worlds (a coin flip, heads or tails, each with probability $1/2$)*... 

*if this person is an 'expected utility maximiser'*, when choosing among lotteries with the same expected monetary payoffs, they prefer the lottery where the payoffs in each state are as similar as possible. Equivalently, if they start with a certain income they will 'reject all fair gambles'.

If they can divide a fixed income $m$ between the 'heads' and 'tails' states, they would divide it equally, setting $x_{heads} = x_{tails} = m/2$. This will maximise their 'expected utility' $\frac{1}{2} v(x_{heads}) + \frac{1}{2} v(x_{tails})$

\

**Time**:

Analogously, suppose there are 'two periods', 'Period 1'  and 'Period 2', that the same individual must divide a fixed income between ($x_1$ in period 1 and $x_2$ in period 2). Assume they do not 'discount future utility'. The 'utility of income function in a period' (equivalent to $v(x)$) is the same in every period.  Thus their 'total stream of utility' simply adds the utility in each period:

$u(x_1, x_2) = v(x_1) + v(x_2)$.  

Suppose they can divide a fixed income $m$ to be used for consumption in either of the two periods (so $x_1+x_2=m$).

This is equivalent to the above 'Risk' problem, with the same concave value function. Thus, they will again divide the consumption equally, setting $x_{1} = x_{2} = m/2$.

<div class="marginnote">
Note there are some criticisms of the standard ways in which both risk-preferences and time-preferences are handled. There is evidence suggesting people do not treat these tradeoffs equivalently. See, e.g., [Andreoni and Sprenger](http://www.dklevine.com/archive/refs4814577000000000452.pdf)

</div>
 
\

When there are diminishing returns to consumption in every period (or in every state) and income can be freely shifted from one period (or equi-probable state) to another, and there is no 'discounting', the individual will set the consumption equal in every period (or state). This is called 'consumption smoothing'. 

<div class="marginnote">
Because of this, the standard economic prediction is that a one-time increase in wealth will have only a small effect on consumption in that period. A general 'consumption smoothing' result also applies when there is discounting, but somewhat less consumption applied to later periods... the ratios of the marginal utilities multiplied by the discount factors will be set equal.
</div>
 



# Exercises - uncertainty, finance, time preferences ('problem set')  {-#ex-uncertainty}


## Some questions from previous exams (somewhat easier questions) {-}

**Hedging bets?** 

Consider Betty, a UK resident working at a company that ships goods from Britain to France. In May 2016, an economist (Al) advises Betty that if the UK votes 'leave' in the June referendum, this may reduce trade with France. Al advises Betty to buy an asset (a 'bet on leave' with a bookmaker) that will pay off in the event that the UK votes for 'leave'. The bookmaker offers odds that are seen as fair, and he only takes a small commission. What would justify the economist's advice to buy this asset? What sort of preferences would Betty have to have to make this advice worth following?

\

*Suggested answer guidelines:* 

```{block2,  type='fold'}

Main points:
  
- If Leave passes she may lose her job or suffer reduced income.

- If she 'bets on leave' this loss would be counterbalanced by an income gain from the asset.

- On the other hand if leave does not pass she keeps her job, but loses the bet.

-  Thus both the gains and losses are reduced by making this bet; i.e., the variance is reduced.

-  If she is *risk-averse* she prefers to reduce the variance of her returns, holding the expected value the same. If she is substantially risk-averse, she is willing to sacrifice at least some amount of expected monetary value (i.e., the commission) to reduce the variance.

\

*Note to Beem101 2020*: this was part of a question on a previous exam. For the upcoming midterm, I would probably add an additional challenging element to such a question, e.g., asking you to formally specify her preferences in some way (concavity of value function, etc.) or consider the measurement of risk (certainty equivalent, Arrow-Pratt measures, etc.)

```

\


**Risk aversion, choices**


Define risk aversion formally and intuitively. Describe one choice that a risk neutral person might make that a risk-averse person would never make. Describe  a particular *measur*} of risk-aversion that would allow us to rank individuals according to their level of risk aversion, considering the strengths and weaknesses of this measure.

\

*Suggested answer guidelines:* 

```{block2,  type='fold'}
A risk averse person always prefers the expected monetary  value of a gamble to the gamble itself. They will never take 'fair bets' and will refuse even some gambles that have a positive expected value. Please see (and present and give intuition for) formal presentations as given [above](#risk-attitude-formal).

If utility is differentiable we can  define risk aversion in terms of a diminishing marginal utility of income (or in general, concavity). More formal definitions, depictions, and intuition is given in this web book [above](#ra_concave).

The 'coefficient of absolute'  risk aversion is one measure but it may not be constant within the range of an individual's income; thus some normalisation or averaging would be required to make this comparison across individuals. 

However, this depends what our purpose is in making this comparison across individuals  -- if we want to compare how risk averse they are given their *current wealth*, this may not be a problem. On the other hand, if we want to make a comparison (e.g., between men and women) to say something about genetic or culturl predisposition to risk-seeking, then the issue of 'differing baseline incomes' may be important. 

'Coefficient of relative risk aversion' is another measure; it also may not be constant throughout the range of income (but that is at least more plausible). These measures, and the intuition for them, are discussed [above](#cara-crra).

\

Other measures include specific empirical elicitations/comparisons as those done in experiments, such as Holt and Laury [discussed here](#exp-risk). (You should briefly characterise it).

These are also arbitrary and may be sensitive to the experimental framing. In particular, there is some evidence (cite) that the Holt and Laury does not substantially predict real-world behavior.  One possibility is that it is too complicated and analytical for most people to handle or to take seriously given low stakes. Another possibility is that the succession of choices presented by HL leads people to consider it in a way they would not naturally have done, to aim for an 'arbitrary coherence'. 


```

\


**Risk aversion and diversification** 

Define 'risk aversion'. Explain why an economist would advise a risk-averse investor to `diversify' her investments.  Would the advice be the same for any risk-averse investor, or would it vary depending on her level of risk-aversion? Does this depend on whether she can borrow or lend at the 'risk-free' rate? . Explain why or why not, referring to equations and diagrams as needed. 


\
```{block2,  type='fold'}


Risk aversion: The extent to which uncertainty of an outcome (holding the expected material or monetary value constant) implies an individual values it less. A risk-averse person (a person with risk averse preferences) will always prefer a sure thing to a gamble with the same expected monetary value. Equivalently, a risk averse person will always reject a fair gamble.


Neoclassical microeconomics concieves of and models this using an 'outcome based' (Von-Neuman Morgenstern) value function that increases at a diminishing rate, and an individual who tries to maximize the expected value of the outcome as measured by this utility function. 


The greater the curvature (relative to the slope) of the VnM utility function, the more risk averse, at least by the [popular 'Arrow-Pratt' measures](#ce-risk-premia).

\
An economist would advise a risk-averse investor to 'diversify' her investments, no matter how risk averse she is ... as long as she is at least a little bit risk-averse, she will prefer to minimise the variance of the return (for a given expected return). As the returns of assets are not perfectly correlated, dividing the investment over 'more coin flips' implies a lower overall variance. (See discussion under ['benefits of diversification'](#diversification)  
as well as the discussion of the [CAPM model](#capm)).
  

This allows her to reduce the variance of her returns for a given expected return, or increase the expected return for a given variance. She can optimise along this margin by 'optimally diversifying', buying assets in proportion to their representation (relative value) in the market. She can then move to her desired point on the  risk/return frontier, aka the 'market line', by either leveraging (borrowing) or putting some of her investment in a risk-free asset. 

\

However (advanced point) if she cannot borrow/lend at the risk-free rate she cannot choose along the 'market line' and thus may not want to diversify quite as much; buying the 'market basket' may then be too-risky/too-safe relative to her preferences. (To fully answer this last part it will help to have read into the 'CAPM' model: see, e.g., the hypothes.is annotated  Wikipedia entries on referred to above).

**Allais paradox** 

Describe the 'Allais paradox', giving a specific example of a set of choices that illustrate this paradox. Explain why these choices are inconsistent with the standard theory of expected utility maximisation. 

\
*Suggested answer guidelines:* 

```{block2,  type='fold'}

Please see lecture notes on [Allais paradox](#allais)


Allais paradox illustrated by a scenario such as

- Gamble A: an 89 percent chance of winning \pounds 1 million a 10 percent chance of winning \£ 5 million, and a 1 pct chance of winning nothing.
- Gamble B: £ 1 million with certainty.


vs

- Gamble C: an 89 percent  chance of winning nothing and an 11\% chance of winning \pounds1 million
- Gamble D: a 90 percent chance of winning nothing and a 10 percent  chance of winning £ 5 million.

\

Many people choose B over A and choose D over C:

This contradicts Expected Utility theory:

- If $B \succ A$ then $EU(A) > EU(B)$
    - $\rightarrow U(1m) > 0.89 \: U(1m) + 0.1 \: U(5m) + 0.01 \: U(0)$
    - $\rightarrow$ $0.11 \: U(1m) >  0.1 U(5m) + 0.01 \: U(0)$
- If $D \succ C$ then $EU(D)>EU(C)$
    - $\rightarrow 0.9 \: U(0) + 0.1 U(5m) > 0.89 \: U(0) + 0.11 \: U(1m)$
    - Implying $0.1 \: U(5m) + 0.01 \: U(0) > 0.11 \: U(1m)$
    - Contradicting the above!

```

**O-R Q2: "A parent"**

> A parent. A parent has two children, A and B. The parent has in hand only one gift. He is indifferent between giving the gift to either child but prefers to toss a fair coin to determine which child obtains the gift over giving it to either of the children. Explain why the parent’s preferences are not consistent with expected utility. 

Hint below:

```{block2,  type='fold'}
Note that expected utility requires the 'independence' property.

# Consumer preferences, constraints and choice, demand functions {#consumers_dmd}

## Consumer preferences, indifference curves/sets (0.5 weeks) {#consumer_pref}

We will cover most of O-R chapter 4, but we will skip section 4.6 (differentiability)

### "Bundles of goods" (O-R 4.1) 

Let's consider two goods only, for now.


```{block2,  type='def'}

In O-R notation:

> The set of alternatives is $X = \mathbb{R}_+^2$. 

> A member of X is called a 'bundle'.

```  

We can consider these bundles as 'vectors' (from linear algebra) with the corresponding operations.  For example, let bundle $x = (x_1, x_2)$. If $\lambda$ is a positive number, we have $\lambda x = (\lambda x_1, \lambda x_2)$. 

We can depict these bundles graphically as vectors (or points) in 2-d space. 

We will later consider 'convex combinations' of particular bundles x and y: $\lambda x + (1- \lambda) y$, for $0 \leq \lambda \leq 1$; all such convex combinations lie on the line segment connecting points x and y.


\

### Preferences over bundles, indifference sets (indifference curves) (O-R 4.2 and supplements) 

```{r  fig.cap = 'From Nicholson and Snyder 2010', out.width='80%', fig.asp=.4, fig.align='center',  echo = FALSE}
 knitr::include_graphics(file.path("picsfigs","moreisbetter.png"))
```

If 'more is preferred to less', we know that all of the points in the darker region are preferred to all of the points in the lighter region. But how can we compare the "?" areas? Which are preferred? This will depend on how an individual weighs tradeoffs between X and Y. 

\

$\rightarrow$  We can  depict this using *Indifference Curves* (indifference sets).

O-R:

> The indifference set for the preference relation $\succsim$ and bundle $a$ is $\{y ∈ X : y \sim a\}$

Read this as 'all y in the choice set X that are seen as equally good as bundle a'.

\

Indifference curve (simpler definition, using utility) 
:     A curve that shows all the combinations of goods or services that provide the same level of utility. (Source: Nicholson and Snyder, 2010)

\

Formally (for 2 goods), the set of pairs of ${x,y}$ such that $U(X,Y)=c$ for some constant c.

Autor:

> Define a level of utility say $U(x) = U$. Then, the indifference curve for U, $IC(U)$ is the locus of consumption bundles that generate utility level U for utility function $U(x)$.


```{r  fig.cap = '', out.width='55%', fig.asp=.4, fig.align='center',  echo = FALSE}

knitr::include_graphics(file.path("picsfigs","indifcurves_util_together.jpg"))

```


Consider the above diagram.
<div class="marginnote">
[Credit: www2.econ.iastate.edu].
</div>

Think of this as a map with a projection above it.

- How far East you go on this map determines how much of the x good is consumed

- How far North you go determines how much of the Y good is consumed.

- How 'high' is the projected image... determines how much utility is obtained from this combination of goods X and Y.

<div class="marginnote">
Hmm... If we think of this as a traveler who loves 'getting high', and  'consumes' by riving East or North, and his utility is his altitude, maybe that helps.
</div>


```{r  fig.cap = '', out.width='70%', fig.asp=.4, fig.align='center',  echo = FALSE}

 knitr::include_graphics(file.path("picsfigs","indif_utility_2_400.jpg"))

```

The above diagram also includes color to depict the utility level, like a 'heat map'. <div class="marginnote">
This diagram is from a very useful resource from MIT, [Frank's Economics on the web](http://web.mit.edu/11.203/www/econ/).]
</div>

### Examples of preferences (over 2 goods) {#example-prefs}

#### Simpler Definitions: Perfect substitutes and complements {-#perfect-sub-comp}

Perfect substitutes 

:     Goods A and B are Perfect Substitutes when an individual's utility is linear in these goods

: when she is always willing to trade off A for B at a fixed rate (not necessarily 1 for 1!)

\

Formally, in O-R 'Example 4.1: constant tradeoff' (for two goods)

> ... $v_i$ is the [numeric] value she assigns to a unit of good $i$ [here, for $i = 1,2$]

> [This preference relation] is defined by ...  $x \succsim y$ if $v_1 x_1 + v_2 x_2 ≥ v_1 y_1 + v_2 y_2$. 

<div class="marginnote">
Obviously this $\succsim$ is represented by the utility function $u(x_1, x_2) = v_1 x_1 + v_2 x_2$.
</div>


\


Perfect complements

:     Goods A and B are Perfect Complements when an individual only gains utility from (more) A if she also consumes a defined (additional) amount of B, and vice-versa

<br> \bigskip

These goods are 'enjoyed only in fixed proportions'. E.g., left and right shoes (1:1) bicycle frames and wheels (1:2) or, perhaps, baking powder and flour (1:40) for someone who only eats soda bread.

<div class="warning">
These are not the same as the 'complements' and 'substitutes' in demand functions which we may see  later, referring to the impact of changing prices.
</div>

\

### Properties: Monotonicity {#monotonicity}

Read O-R section 4.3.

```{block2,  type='tip'}
Know how to define, test, and compare at least two 'monotonicity-type' assumptions, e.g., Monotonicity vs Strong Monotonicity; see O-R p. 49.

Know how monotonicity rules out 'bliss points'
``` 

\

<center>
![Indifference curve for a 'bliss point' preference](picsfigs/mcdl_iso_bliss.png)

[See McDL on 'Bliss points'](https://saylordotorg.github.io/text_introduction-to-economic-analysis/s13-04-examples.html)
</center>


<div class="marginnote">
Note that what McDL  refer to as 'Isoquants' is a general term for a 'level set.' Indifference curves are a 'level set for utility' (if we have a utility representation).
</div>


\


```{block2,  type='note'}

Monotonicity (essentially) yields 'optimizing consumers spend all their wealth over the relevant lifetime'. It enables:

- Easier computation of optimization problems (with an equality rather than an inequality constraint
)
- Easier and the 'comparative statics' of these optimization problems

- The derivation of results from ['adding up restriction']{#aggregation}
```

```{block2,  type='inputq'}

Explain the examples in the O-R table:

- How do we know that 'constant tradeoff preferences' exhibit monotononicity?
   
- Explain/prove that 'complementary goods' do not exhibit strong monotonicity.
   
- Prove that lexicographic preferences have *strong* monotonicity

```  

\


### Properties: continuity - discussed [in a previous section](#continuity)

\

### Properties: Convexity (skipping the proofs) {#convexity}

Read O-R section 4.5, skipping the proofs, if you like.


```{block2,  type='def'}

**(weak) Convexity** (O-R definition)

> $\succsim$ on $\mathbf{R}^2_+$ is convex if $a \succsim b \rightarrow \lambda a + (1 − \lambda)b \succsim b$ for all $\lambda \in (0,1)$

\

**Strict Convexity** of $\succsim$ (O-R definition)
...

> if $a \succsim b$ and $a \neq b \rightarrow \lambda a + (1 − \lambda)b \succ b$ for all $\lambda \in (0,1)$

```  

Simply, weak convexity implies that convex combinations of two distinct bundles, one at least as good as the other, is at least as good as the 'weakly worse' bundle. 

Strict convexity implies that this convex combination is *strictly preferred* to the 'weakly worse' worse bundle. 

Note that as $\succsim$ also holds (in both directions) for two bundles where $a \sim b$, weak (strict) convexity implies that a convex combination of such bundles will also be at least as good as (better than) either bundle.\*

<div class="marginnote">
Reading tip: when we make an mathematical statement and put  multiple things in parentheses, you can read this sentence either 'reading everything in parentheses' or 'reading none of the parentheses'.

E.g., "In (New) York people should (not) drive on the left side of the road."

</div>


\

An equivalent definition involving 'upper contour sets' 

```{block2,  type='fold'}

(proved equivalent in O-R proposition 4.2):


> $\succsim$ convex if and only if for all $x^ {\ast} \in X$ the
set $\{x \in X : x \succsim x^{\ast}\}$ ...  is convex.
 
\

In other words, it is the same as saying 

'the set of all bundles at least as good as some bundle' ... (which we call the 'upper contour set') is a convex set.seed(

A 'convex set' is a set that is 'closed under convex combinations', i.e., it contains  all of its convex combinations. For any two elements in a convex set, the convex combination of these elements is in the set as well.\*

<div class="marginnote">
A convex set is pretty easy to visualise for a set in 2 or 3 dimensional space ... but much harder when we go to higher dimensions. Yet most of the proofs will indeed generalise to higher dimensions. Remember, when we are dealing with real-world products and bundles, we are dealing with many important dimensions. E.g., a box of cereal could be considered to be described by a vector (or list) of characteristics, including, sweetness, saltiness, crunch, calories, carbohydrates, etc.... all of which a consumer may care about
</div>
 
```      


\


```{r block05, fig.cap = 'Convex preferences - from McDL', out.width='60%', fig.asp=.6, fig.align='center', echo = FALSE}

 knitr::include_graphics(file.path("picsfigs","mcdl_convex_pref_indif.png"))

```

Be sure you understand the difference between the definition of convexity and strict convexity here.

</center>

***

```{block2,  type='warning'}

> A preference relation on  $R^2_+$ that is represented by a (quasi)-concave [utility] function is convex.

It will also have convex indifference curves, implying that the 'weakly preffered to sets' are convex. 

Make sure you don't get this confused.

See O-R proposition 4.3 and its proof.
```

\

> The convexity of a strongly monotone preference relation is connected with the property known as decreasing marginal rate of substitution. (O-R)

<div class="marginnote">
Please see the O-R numerical/parametric example offering insight into this, beginning "consider three bundles." If time permits I'll make a quick video on this.
</div>
 

\

```{block2,  type='note'}

Convexity of preferences will ensure 'well behaved consumer responses', including demand responses to price (i.e., 'demand curves'). Without convexity we may see abrupt and discontinuous shifts in the quantity of a good demanded in response to (small) changes in price.

```


```{block2,  type='inputq'}
Convexity is a convenient assumption, but not one that is reasonable in all cases. Can you give some insight as to why not, and give some examples of cases where the indifference curves between two goods may fail to be convex ... and may be concave, at least within certain regions?
```

```{block2,  type='fold'}
Consider 'substitute goods' like

A. petrol (gasoline) versus B. diesel, or

A. scuba equipment versus B. skiing gear.

In these cases is easy to see why I may prefer 'a lot of A or B' over 'a medium amount of A and B', and my willingness to give up a good might *decrease* rather than increase as I have more of that good.

```

\

**How to show (mathematically) that preferences (and indifference curves are convex)?** 

```{block2,  type='fold'}

The answers [here](https://www.quora.com/How-can-I-mathematically-prove-that-indifference-curves-are-convex-shaped-with-derivatives) ... by Abrink and Teytelboym appear correct. However, I do not want to get into this computational issue in this module. (However, it is covered in the 'optimisation' module).

 
```


\

#### More general concept: [quasiconcavity (optional, linked as supplement)](#quasi-conc)   {-}

This is the 'preferred assumption' which resembles convexity, but has several advantages as a concept. For example, it doesn't require differentiable preferences, and its properties are not affected by monotonic transformations of utility functions. This is the concept that you might be taught in a PhD or MRes module. I think it may also have some value in understanding optimization problems in general, which is an important part of research and industry and finance, I believe.  [Linked as supplement here](#quasi-conc).

\

### (Differentiability: mainly skip) {-}

```{block2,  type='note'}
You can skip O-R's discussion of  differentiability.

However,  do have a look at O-R figure 4.5  to get a sense of what differentiability  means for indifference curves (indifference sets).

```


```{block2,  type='inputq'}

![](picsfigs/200px-Indifference-curves-perfect-complements.svg.png)^[Image source: SilverStar at English Wikipedia, CC BY-SA 3.0 <http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/>, via Wikimedia Commons]


1. What do these indifference curves depict?
   
2. What might be a functional (utility) form consistent with these indifference curves?  

3. Are these preferences 'everywhere differentiable'? Explain why or why not.

4. Give a real-world example of a case where such preferences might be relevant.
   
```  

\

### Applications: Product positioning, marketing

<!-- I hope to add more content to be added here, including applications directly from the private sector.
-->

Do people have a preference for balance? (Convex indifference curves)?

Naive argument?: If market research suggests that a broad group are indifferent between two options A and C, maybe they strictly prefer G  $\rightarrow$ a possible *niche* for a new profitable product?

<br>

```{block2,  type='inputq'}

But what may be a critique, exception to this logic, e.g., for a particular food?

```


```{block2,  type='fold'}

-  Convex preferences, 'preferring mixtures' is a very strong assumption, unlikely to hold everywhere, or for actual *mixtures*.   I may be indifferent between liver and custard, but it doesn't mean that I prefer liver-flavoured custard, nor even necessarily equal amounts of liver and custard side by side.


- Producing an 'intermediate' attribute may be more costly; it may be easy to make crunchy but low-taste cereal or tasty but low-crunch cereal, but expensive to make a cereal with both attributes.

E.g., it's hard to make a car that is spacious *and* fast.

```

\

**Utility/indifference curves: Also a framework for marketing analysis**

```{block2,  type='note'}

The utility and indifference curve construct may seem highly theoretical. Indeed, these models were developed largely to address big questions like 'who gains from trade?'  Still, it helps organise thinking and analysis for at least some managers and marketing groups.  According to Nicholson and Snyder (2010) Marriot hotel used focus groups to 'construct (multidimensional) indifference curves' to consider their ideal product positioning.

I have seen a similar presentation for other hotels presented at [Behavioural boozeonomics](https://www.meetup.com/London-behavioural-comms-monthly-informal-drinks/) in London.

This may also provide a structure to guide data-driven 'searches for the next best product'.
```


\

One (often survey-based) approach to this is called 'conjoint analysis' or 'conjoint modeling'.  Consider: How would the assumptions of this approach, as described below, translate into microeconomic assumptions about choices and preferences? 

\

*Note: the site [provided by  'Qresearch', part of a commercial firm](https://www.qresearchsoftware.com/conjoint-analysis-the-basics) states things in loose terms, for those without Economics training.*

### Choices are subject to constraints {#constraints}

You cannot spend more than your (lifetime) income or wealth $\rightarrow$ *budget constraints* (and 'budget sets').

<div class="marginnote">
There are also other potential constraints on consumption, such as a leisure time constraint and legal constraints.
</div>


Consider the budget line given in figure 5.1 in O-R.


<!--
```{r  fig.cap = 'Budget constraint for two goods', out.width='80%', fig.asp=.4, fig.align='center',  echo = FALSE}

knitr::include_graphics(file.path("picsfigs","budgetconstraint.png"))

```
-->

Budget constraint for two goods, slope  $-p_{x_1}/p_{x_2}$


<div class="marginnote">
Only two goods?  For example, think 'food' and 'nonfood'.
</div>

\


#### Budget constraint algebra (simple) {-}

<div class="marginnote">
*I realise this may be trivial for many of you, but others will find this a helpful refresher. If it is obvious, feel free to skip ahead.

I made a video with some simple algebra for budget constraints you can access [here](https://www.dropbox.com/preview/large_videos/msc_micro/simple_budget_constraint_algebra/simple_budget_constraint_algebra.mp4?role=personal)

</div>


If I spend all my wealth (which I should do over a 'relevant lifetime' given monotonic preferences), then, if there are only two goods $x_1$ and $x_2$ to choose from, with prices $p_1$ and $p_2$ respectively ...:

\


Expenditure on $x_1$ + Expenditure on $x_2$ = wealth ($w$)


$$p_1 x_1 + p_2 x_2 = w $$


<br> 


To see how $x_1$ trades off against $x_2$, rearrange this to:

$$x_2 =  \frac{w}{p_2} -\frac{p_1}{p_2}x_1$$

- Intercept:  $\frac{w}{P_2}$, i.e., amount of $x_2$ you can buy if you only buy $x_2$

- Slope: $-\frac{p_1}{p_2}$, i.e.,  how much $x_2$ you must give up to get another unit of $x_1$


<br>

*Notes and intuition* (unfold if you want more explanation)

```{block2,  type='fold'}

The slope $-\frac{p_1}{p_2}$: How much $x_2$ I must sacrifice to get another unit of $x_1$, expressed as a negative number. (Strictly speaking, the slope is how much $x_2$ you *get* when you get another $x_1$, but since this is negative we see that you 'get a negative amount', i.e., give up some amount of $x_2$.)

To get another unit of $x_1$ it costs me $p_1 x_1$, so the more costly is $x_1$ the *more* $x_2$ I must give up.

For each unit of $x_2$ I give up I save $p_2$, so the more costly is $x_2$ the more I can save by giving up 1 unit of it, thus, the less I need to sacrifice of $x_2$ to get another unit of $x_1$.

```

<div class="marginnote">
O-R also refer to a different way of presenting the consumer's environment: 

> Rather than assuming that the consumer can purchase the goods at given prices using his wealth, assume that he initially owns a bundle $e$ and can exchange goods at the fixed rate of one unit of good 1 for $\beta$ units of
good 2.

This presentation helps us consider the welfare properties of exchange economies under different conditions and 'initial allocations'. However, we will not be covering this here.

#### Budget sets (O-R 5.1, formal presentation); normalization {-}

```{block2,  type='def'}

O-R definition (for two goods)

> ... the budget set of a consumer with wealth $w$ when the prices are ($p_1, p 2$) is

$$B((p_1, p 2), w) = \{(x_1,x_2) \in X : p_1 x_1 + p_2 x_2 \leq w \}$$

(Note that the part after the colon ($p_1 x_1 + p_2 x_2 \leq w$) is referred to as the 'budget constraint')

>   The set $\{(x_1,x_2) \in X : p_1 x_1 + p_2 x_2 = w \}$ is the consumer’s budget line

```

\

O-R continue:

> Geometrically, a budget set is a triangle like the one in Figure 5.1. Note that multiplying wealth and prices by the same positive number does not change the set:

> $B((\lambda p_1,\lambda p_2), \lambda w) = B((p_1, p_2), w)$ for any $\lambda > 0$,

> because the inequalities $\lambda p_1 x_1 + \lambda p_2 x_2 \leq \lambda w$ and $p_1 x 1 + p_2 x_2 \leq w$ that define these sets are equivalent


\

Multiply all prices and income by the same amount, and the *budget constraint is unchanged.* This will imply that we can simplify any such maximization problem by "normalizing" the budget constraint so that one good simply has price equal to one.  (But if this is an applied problem, we should remember to convert it back into the actual prices.) (See my ['numeraire good' video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HAA0Q_3YoS).)


<div class="marginnote">

Also:  As the budget constraints are unchanged when all prices and wealth are increased by the same proportion, neither will be the choices made; thus demand functions must be "homogenous of degree zero", as noted below. 
</div>

<!-- I hope to make a video of this here.-->

\

**"Every budget set is convex"** (\*)

As O-R show algebraically (for two goods, but this would extend to $n$ goods)...

- if any two bundles $a$ and $b$ are both within a particular budget set, a third bundle that is a "convex combination" of these two bundles will also be in this budget set.

<div class="marginnote">

\* This holds as a result of constant linear pricing; in the proof you see this is used.  With complicated (e.g., nonlinear) pricing, or subsidies that only apply to certain units (recall 'eat out to help out'?) budget constraints may not have this property. Perhaps it is reasonable to assume that a 'standard small consumer' faces constant prices for many goods. On the other hand, we can think of all sorts of exceptions, where you get a discount if you buy in bulk and also note that you cannot buy, e.g., "one third of a car."  With nonlinear budget constraints  optimization problems become much more mathematically "interesting".
</div>

\

What's a "convex combination"? (unfold)

```{block2,  type='fold'}

Essentially this is just a fancy economics word for "shares of two things adding to one".

It is simply some (non-negative) share of the first bundle and one minus this share of the second bundle.  E.g., 100% of the  first bundle and none of the second bundle, or 50% of each bundle, or 25% of the first bundle and 75% of the second bundle. (Obviously this could be extended to to multiple bundles too.)

Think also about 'dividing up two bundles'. We see  that if there are two bundles out there and one person takes a convex combination of these that is convex, what remains is also a convex combination of these.

\

Formally the convex combinations of bundles $A$ and $B$ (where A and B are vectors) are simply $\delta A + (1-\delta) B$, where $0 \leq \delta \leq 1$. (This can be extended to convex combinations of several bundles to consider a 'convex hull', and each bundle can have as many elements as desired.)

\

Consider of any two bundles A and B, each with two elements, plotted on the coordinate plane. Any convex combination of A and B is a  points on the straight line connecting A and B.  Thus the line connecting A and B contains *all* such convex combinations. Each particular convex combination $delta A + (1-\delta) B$ will be the point$\delta$ share of the distances between A and B. 

\

We could use this to demonstrate "gains to trade". Suppose two people with the same preferences, each with a distinct bundle (at a point other than the one where their MRS are the same). They can divide up these bundles among each other, one taking a convex combination of the bundles, and the other taking the remainder, which is also a convex combination.

 See [THIS SUPPLEMENT](#gain-to-trade) for more detail.

### Individual (consumer) demand functions (Marshallian demand) - first pass {#demand1}

```{block2,  type='def'}

O-R:

> A demand function is a function $x$ that assigns to each budget set one of its members.

> Define $x((p_1, p_2), w)$ to be the bundle assigned to the budget set $B((p_1, p_2), w)$.

(It is easy to imagine extending this to a case with many goods to choose from, rather than just two.)

```


O-R note that if you multiply all prices and wealth by some positive constant $\lambda$, the budget set is unchanged; thus the demand function is also unchanged. 

<div class="marginnote">
As the demand function is (stated above to be) a function of the budget set, and nothing else, (at least holding preferences constant), if the 'budget set as an argument' is unchanged, the output must not change.

Considering $x(p_1, p_2, w)$ as a simple function of three arguments, this implies it has the mathematical property 'homogenous of degree zero'. A function is 'homogenous of degree $n$' when multiplying all of its inputs by some number $\lambda$ causes the output to be multiplied by $\lambda^{n}$. ... Here, Hd-0, so $\lambda^{0} = 1$ .... i.e., the output is unchanged.
</div>

\

```{block2,  type='inputq'}
O-R present 'individual demand functions' *before* presenting the optimisation problem. This is unusual... why do they do this?

```


```{block2,  type='fold'}
They highlight that the demand function does not *need* to arise from an optimization process (as we describe below)... it merely maps from the budget set to a particular choice.

This can arise as a result of a simple rule or "heuristic" such as "spend equal amount of income on each good". Behavioral economics considers the implications of decisions made on the basis of such heuristics.

```

\

Types of demand functions: Marshallian and Hicksian... 

```{block2,  type='fold'}

These demand functions are stated as a function of the  budget set, or more simply, as functions of price and wealth (or income). These are referred to as the "Marshallian demand functions" after the great Alfred Marshall.  These are the demand functions that we may actually be able to observe in the real world. Marshallian demands show the optimal amount of a good as a function of prices and income. I.e. $x_1(p_1, p_2, m)$. The function tells us how demand for, say $x_1$ responds to changes in price holding income fixed.

[There are another type of demand functions that have very interesting properties for theory and welfare analysis called "Hicksian demand functions" or "compensated demand functions"](#hicksian). These take prices and *utility* as the arguments.  We will not cover these in 2020 because of time constraints. But as an Economist you should have some familiarity with this.
   
```

\

### Rational consumer and his/her optimisation problem {#rat-opt}

We started with an individual's preferences, one of the base elements of the neoclassical model. Under some conditions these can be described by utility functions,  which we may consider as 'mountains'  with levels sets depicted by indifference curves.

So, we have a way of depicting what people prefer,  but this doesn't tell us what people will *choose* to consume (and firms to produce).

We next introduced the second fundamental element of the neoclassical model, constraints, in particular, the budget constraint.

We put these together to describe the consumer's problem: maximizing her utility subject to her budget constraints.  This is depicted in figure below for the two-good case.

<div class="marginnote">
Image Source: https://courses.byui.edu/econ_150/econ_150_old_site/lesson_05.htm
</div>


(Or see O-R fig 5.3)

 knitr::include_graphics(file.path("picsfigs","crop-byui-5-2_Indifference_Curves_08.png"))
```

Imagine that you are this consumer with these preferences and this budget constraint. You can choose any point at or below the straight blue line, as it is on or below your budget constraint. You want to get to the highest indifference curve, to attain the most utility.\*

<div class="marginnote">
 
\* Again, this is material that you will have seen before if you have studied Economics. Feel free to skip this if you remember it all; the O-R text gives a concise explanation.

As this is a bit remedial I will not cover it in detail. I suggest the [Khan academy videos/materials here](https://www.khanacademy.org/economics-finance-domain/microeconomics/choices-opp-cost-tutorial/utility-maximization-with-indifference-curves/v/optimal-point-on-budget-line) if you need revision.
</div>

\

```{block2,  type='inputq'}

How do we know point B is suboptimal (i.e., not optimal)? What about point D? What about points between A and B? How do such points compare with point B?

```

```{block2,  type='fold'}
We can see B is suboptimal as it is on a lower indifference curve than A, but both are on the same budget line. Same for D. 

In fact, if we assumed even *weak monotonicity* we would already know that point A was preferred to point D. 

Points between A and B are also below the '$U=100$' indifference curve... again, with weak (or strict) monotonicity these must be inferior to point A (but superior to point B). 

```



<br> \bigskip

We can demonstrate that you will choose point A, yielding utility $100$. What is special about point A?

It's the point of *tangency* between the budget constraint and an indifference *curve*. It's also (not a coincidence) the point where the slopes are equal. At this point (but not in general!) we have that  "Slope of budget constraint = slope of indifference curve".

<!-- <div class="marginnote">
Recall that the  $\leftrightarrow$ symbol means 'if  and only if', i.e., the  object on the right-hand side implies the object on the left-hand side, and vice versa. In  some contexts this means a 'necessary and sufficient condition',  but here it is just basically a definition.

### Marginal rates of substitution {#mrs}

O-R section 5.4 'Differentiable preferences'


```{block2,  type='note'}
Note that O-R use the notation

$v_1(z)$ and $v_2(z)$ to represent "the consumer’s valuations
of small changes in the amounts of the goods she consumes away from z". They refer to the consumer's 'local valuations at z' (remember that $z$ is a bundle of goods).

This is usually referred to as the *marginal utility*; the partial derivative of the utility function with respect to each argument (each good or service), at a particular point (bundle), say $z = (x_1, x_2)$:

$$mu_1(z) \equiv \frac{d}{d x_1} u(x_1, x_2)$$

```

\

```{block2,  type='def'}

O-R define the "marginal rate of substitution at $z$ ... $MRS(z)$" as $v_1(z)/v_2(z)$

Assume bundle $z$ contains elements $x_1$ and $x_2$. Relating this to a more standard notation:

$$MRS(z) = MRS(x_1,x_2) = v_1(x_1,x_2)/v_2(x_1,x_2)=\frac{mu_1(x_1,x_2)}{mu_2(x_1, x_2)}$$

```


```{block2,  type='note'}
I prefer to define and think of the MRS as

> Starting from a particular point ($x_1', x_2'$) how much $x_2$ would I be willing to give up to get a unit of $x_1$'? (As this 'unit size' converges to 0, as we are considering a point slope here. )

Or starting from a particular point ... if I gained a tiny tiny  unit of $x_1$ how much $x_2$ would I have to give up to hold my utility constant?

I loosely derive the 'ratio of the marginal utilities' from this definition [BELOW](#mrsinsight), offering some insight.

```

\

Above, at an optimal interior consumption choice, we had that the  "slope of budget constraint = slope of indifference curve"... at least that's what it looked like.

\


This is equivalent to "the point or bundle (which we will call $x^{\ast}$) where the price ratio equals the marginal rate of substitution", i.e., the point $x^{\ast} \equiv (x_1^{\ast},x_2^{\ast})$ where

$$p_1/p_2 = MRS(x^{\ast}) = MU_1(x^{\ast})/MU_2(x^{\ast}) =v_1(x^{\ast})/v_2(x^{\ast}) $$ holds.

\
<!--
*Note on why the negative signs 'cancel out:*
```{block2,  type='fold'}

Recall that the  slopes of the budget line and the slope of the relevant indifference curve are actually negative. However, recall that we usually state the MRS as the *absolute value* of this, so it is positive, and thus we similarly multiply the slope of the  budget constraint by negative one. As you know, multiplying both sides of a (nonzero) equation by negative one leaves the solution unchanged. More simply, where both slopes are negative, 'the slopes are equal' is the same as saying 'the absolute value of the slopes are equal.

```

-->

```{block2,  type='warning'}

Warning:  Recall that the marginal rate of substitution may vary everywhere along an indifference curve (remember the idea of satiation and diminishing MRS).

Unfold for further explanation...
```


```{block2,  type='fold'}

It is a function of the *point* it is evaluated, i.e., $MRS = MRS(x_1, x_2)$. It is only at the *point where the consumer is optimizing* that these slopes *must* be equal.

\

They can also be equal at some other suboptimal points, where she is not spending all of her income... (e.g., perhaps point D in the above figure).

Where she is consuming some of every good, this is a *necessary* condition for such a point to represent an optimal consumption choice, but it may not be a sufficient condition.  May also be optimal for her to consume *none*  of certain goods,  in which case this condition  will not hold. We return to this later.

```

\

#### At an optimal 'interior' consumption choice (with strict convexity, see above note and discussion of 'corners' [below](#corners)) {-}

- Consume all of income (locate *on* budget line; follows from 'more is better')

- The "Psychic tradeoff" (MRS) equals the market tradeoff ($p_X/p_Y$)


Intuition: If I can give up X for Y in the market (buy less X, get more Y) at a certain rate, and the *benefit* I get from doing this is at a different rate, I can make myself better off.

Thus the original point could not have been optimal!

![](picsfigs/glasses.png){width=20%}


<div class="marginnote">

If this is not clear to you, try to think about this carefully. This is a key insight in microeconomics, a sort of 'marginality' argument/'proof  by contradiction'. that will come back later.

</div>


### Very simple example, for intuition {-}


```{block2,  type='fold'}


Suppose that at the consumption bundle you choose, your MRS = 1. To remain indifferent, you would be willing to give up 1 hamburger to get 1 soda.

Suppose the price of soda is £1 and the price of a hamburger is £2. $\rightarrow$ Price ratio: $P_S/P_B = 1/2$

Thus if you buy one less hamburger you can buy two more sodas.
Thus if you give up one hamburger, you can get one more soda to keep you indifferent *plus* an additional soda.
This means you would be better off; thus the original bundle *wasn't* optimal.

Practice question: in which direction would you adjust this bundle if the price of a soda was £2 and a hamburger was £1?

```



\

More extended example... (unfold)

```{block2,  type='fold'}
E.g., if I can give up one glass of wine and gain two beers (i.e., because wine is twice as costly), and (given my proposed consumption of wine and beer) I get the same value from each glass of wine or beer, I can give up this glass of wine, gain two beers, and make myself 'one unit' better off, at the margin.


On the other hand, if I can give up one glass of wine and gain two beers (i.e., because wine is twice as costly), and (given my proposed consumption of wine and beer) I get the four times as much value from each glass of wine as each beer, I can give up two beers, gain a wine (which I value at four beers) and make myself 'two units' better off, at the margin.

However, I can *not* apply this argument to a point where I am consuming *only* wine... I cannot consume less than no beer (although some nights I wish I could have done). We return to this point [below](corners)
```

\


### More insight into MRS  {-#mrsinsight}

Recall $u=u(x_1, x_2)$.

$$U_1(x_1,x_2) \equiv MU_{x_1}(x_1,x_2)$$

\

*Derivative with respect to $x_1$: rate that utility increases if we add a little $x_1$, holding $x_2$ constant.*

Similarly for $MU_{x_2}$.


<br> \bigskip

As noted (and we can derive this), the MRS at a point is the ratio of these marginal utilities.

MRS: 'how much $x_2$ would I be willing to give up to get a unit of $x_1$'?

<br> \bigskip

Ans: Depends on marginal benefit of each ... we can show $MRS(x_1,x_2)=\frac{MU_{x_1}}{MU_{x_2}}$


```{block2,  type='note'}

*Mathy intuition:*

The more valuable a little more X is to me at that point -- the higher is $MU_{x_1}$ -- the more $x_2$ I am willing to give up to get it. That is why $MU_{x_1}$ is in the numerator.

The more valuable a bit more $x_2$ is at that point -- the higher is $MU_{x_2}$ -- the less $x_2$ I am willing to give up to get a bit more $x_1$. That is why $MU_{x_2}$ is in the denominator.

```

\


The 'first order change in utility' (or 'total differential'), considering 'small changes in $x_1$ and $x_2$, $d_{x_1}$ and $d_{x_2}$ is:

$$ dU  = \frac{\partial U}{\partial x_1}d_{x_1} + \frac{\partial U}{\partial x_2}d_{x_2}$$
$$ = MU_{x_1}d_{x_1} + MU_{x_2}d_{x_2}$$

... Where  $\frac{\partial U}{\partial x_1}$ refers to the partial derivative of $U(x_1,x_2)$ with respect to $x_1$, and similarly for $x_2$, i.e., the marginal utility.

\


Essentially, for very small changes in X and Y;  this approximates the total change in utility. It's a 'linear projection'.

Setting it equal to 0 and rearranging yields the rate, at the margin, one is willing to give up $x_2$ for $x_1$:

$$dU  = MU_{x_1}d_{x_1} + MU_{x_2}d_{x_2} = 0 $$

Rearranging...

$$\frac{dx_2}{dx_1}=-\frac{MU_{x_1}}{MU_{x_2}}$$

<div class="marginnote">
**Tech note**:  This is a simple case of the implicit function theorem. Essentially $U(x_1,x_2)=c$ defines an implicit function $x_2(x_1)$, whose slope is the negative of the ratio of the derivatives.
</div>



<br>

Rearranging the utility maximising condition yields further intuition:

$$\frac{P_X}{P_Y} = MRS(z^*) = \frac{MU_X(z^*)}{MU_Y(z^*)}$$

(at each interior consumption point $X>0$, $Y>0$)

$$\frac{MU_X}{P_X} = \frac{MU_Y}{P_Y}.$$


<br> \bigskip

I.e., the same 'bang for each buck'.

*Note:* If this didn't hold true and you were spending on both goods, you would be paying 'more per util' for one good than the other, and thus should reallocate to that other good.

\


### Note on 'corner solutions' {#corners}

The above 'bang for the buck' condition applies to any *interior* solution

- If you are consuming both goods and optimising, $P_{x_1}/P_{x_2} = MRS = MU_{x_1}/MU_{x_2}$ must hold

- This is a "necessary but not sufficient condition", sufficient if there is a diminishing MRS everywhere.

But you might consume *none* of some good (say $x_1$):

If even with *no*  $x_1$  we still have $MU_{x_1}/P_{x_1} <MU_{x_2}/P_{x_2}$

- i.e., the marginal utility of the first unit of $x_1$ is less than that of $x_2$.


The same condition applies to each good you are consuming a positive amount of.

### Overview: Solution to consumer's problem {#cons-solution}

#### General solution (two goods) {-}

O-R (proposition 5.1) present the basic results for the *solution to a consumer's problem* (at least for two goods):

> [Consider] a preference relation on $\mathbf{R}_+^2$ and a budget set

> a. If the preference relation is continuous then the consumer’s problem has a solution.

By this they mean, that 'there is a highest point in this set'. They cite a 'standard mathematical result'. 

<div class="marginnote">
This seems obvious; at first glance you might think 'every set must have a minimal and maximal element'. 

But then, think about the set "numbers that are strictly below 10". Is there a largest number in this set? (No, there isn't.) 
</div>
 

> b. If the preference relation is strictly convex then the consumer’s problem has at most one solution.

The proof of this is pretty neat!

```{block2,  type='fold'}

First they 'assume the negation of b holds' ... and look for a contradiction: 
   
> Assume that distinct bundles $a$ and $b$ are both solutions to a consumer’s problem. 


> Then the bundle $(a +b)/2$ is in the budget set (which is convex); by the strict convexity of the preference relation this bundle is strictly preferred to both $a$ and $b$.

So, 'if there are two optimal distinct bundles, there must be an even better bundle.' Thus, a contradiction... so the negation of b cannot hold... there cannot be two distinct optimal bundles. 

```


> c. If the preference relation is monotone then any solution of the consumer’s problem is on the budget line

(This one seems pretty obvious, skip the proof)

\

#### Solution with monotone, convex, and differentiable preference relation (two goods)

O-R summarize this nicely, allowing for the possibility of corner solutions"


> Assume that a consumer has a monotone, convex, and differentiable preference relation on $\mathbf{R}_+^2$. If $x^{\ast}$ is a solution of the consumer’s problem for $(p_1, p_2, w)$ then

> a. $x_1^{\ast}> 0$ and $x_2 > 0$ $\rightarrow MRS(x^{\ast}) = p_1/p_2$

> b. $x_1^{\ast} = 0 \rightarrow MRS(x^{\ast}) \leq p_1/p_2$

> c. $x_2^{\ast} = 0 \rightarrow MRS(x^{\ast}) \geq p_1/p_2$

```{block2,  type='inputq'}

Consider each case for a-c, depicting these graphically. (See, e.g., O-R example 5.8)

```  

\

<div class="marginnote">
You may also be familiar with the Lagrangian approach to constrained optimization. The interior solution (ignoring the corner solutions, i.e., not presenting the Kuhn-Tucker Lagrangian) is very quickly derived from the Lagrangian formula [here, by Professor Joon Song](https://www.dropbox.com/s/frgrfbihgh1nsye/joon_lagrangian_consumer_opt.mp4?dl=0)

### Some 'popular' forms for utility functions, and their properties; computation {#util-forms}



#### Cobb-Douglas general form  {-#cobbdoug}

$$U(X,Y)=X^aY^b$$

where a, b are positive constants


<br> 


This is *"homothetic"* ... what does this mean? (unfold)

```{block2,  type='fold'}

Homothetic: MRS constant along a ray through the origin.

$\rightarrow$  It can be represented by an HD1 utility function. This ties down 'income effects' in a boring way: consumption of each good expands proportionally in income.



...So the poor man just buys a tiny amount of *foies gras* and jumps in his tiny money bin.


![](picsfigs/Money-Bin.jpg){width=30%}

Thus if everyone has these preferences th  impact of one consumer's income increasing by £1 million is the same as 1 million consumers gaining £1. This (possibly dubious) assumption underlies 'representative consumer' models.



\

A more formal and complete explanation of Homothetic preferences:

<br> \bigskip


$$MU_X=\frac{\partial U}{\partial X} = aX^{a-1}Y^b$$
$$MU_Y=\frac{\partial U}{\partial Y} = bX^{a}Y^b-1$$

<br> \bigskip


Taking the ratio of these yields

$$MRS = \frac{a}{b}\frac{Y}{X}$$


<br> \bigskip


So only the *ratio* Y/X affects the MRS; double both, MRS is the same.


<br> \bigskip


<div class="marginnote">
 Another relevant example: 'Constant Elasticity of Substitution preferences'.
</div>




#### A non-homothetic (here, 'Quasilinear') example {-#quasilinear}


$$U(X,Y)=X+ln(Y)$$


Here $Y$ has a diminishing MU, but for $X$ MU is constant


$$\frac{MU_X}{MU_Y}= \frac{1}{1/Y}=Y$$

So the MRS diminishes as $Y$ decreases (as we go 'down the indifference curve' ... this is what we confusingly call diminishing MRS), but it is independent of the amount of $X$ consumed.

```{block2,  type='inputq'}

So, if we double both then what happens?

```

```{block2,  type='fold'}
Ans: MRS doubles

```
\

This represents *Quasilinear* preferences:

```{r  fig.cap = '', out.width='50%', fig.asp=.4, fig.align='center',  echo = FALSE}
 knitr::include_graphics(file.path("picsfigs","Quasilinear_utility.png"))
```

These are particularly relevant with three or more goods.

More generally, quasilinear utility satisfies $U=x_1+f(x_2,...,x_n)$; i.e., it is linear in one 'numeraire' good $x_1$.\* 

<div class="marginnote">
\* I discuss a numeraire price in [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HAA0Q_3YoSc).

</div>
 

Here, the amount of the 'non-numeraire goods' consumed adjust to match the price ratio but *don't* depend on the income.

We imagine that 'the tradeoff between these goods is the same for people of all income levels'.

E.g., in principal-agent analysis we can then ignore the question 'but won't the preference for leisure change when people are richer'?

*Mathy intuition:* if the 'Y' goods $(x2,..., xn)$ have more MU consume them 'first', until their MU diminishes to that of the numeraire, then consume X.


### Rationalizing a demand function (Skip O-R section 5.5) {#}

We already considered 'rationalizability of a choice function' ... so I won't cover this special case.

2. All points on or below the green line ... budget set $B'$

\

```{block2,  type='inputq'}

*Is it possible* that she would choose bundle $b$ in the (blue) budget set $B$, and that this same person choose bundle $a$ when faced with the (green) budget set $B'$?

Would this contradict rationality and monotonicity?

```  

```{block2,  type='fold'}

Indeed it would violate one or both of these. 

It would violate what we define as the 'Weak Axiom of Revealed Preferences, as discussed below.

```


\

**The main point**

Note that both $b$ and $a$ were available in the (blue) budget set $B$. If she chose $b$ here, if she is optimizing, she must find it to be 'at least as good as $a$' ... $b \succsim a$, according to her preferences. We will say that such a choice implies '$b$ is revealed directly weakly preferred to $a$, or '$b R^{D} a$'. (O-R say 'revealed at least as good'). 

<div class="marginnote">
The $R^{D}$ and $P^{D}$ notation comes from Varian 1992; it is not used in O-R.
Note that Varian seems to define the WARP differently, saying that it rules out that both $A R^{D} B$ and $B R^{D} A$ when $A$ and $B$ are distinct bundles. I will stick with the  definition from O-R (also consistent with the current Wikipedia entry.)
</div>

\
   
Now note that in the (green) budget set $B'$, both $b$ and $a$ are again available. In fact now, we note that in the green budget set 'bundles with more of both goods than b' are available. 

So if she now chooses $a$ this tells us that she prefers $a$ to *points with more of both goods than $b$'!* 

<div class="marginnote">
As O-R note: 

> For example, if an individual purchases the bundle (2,0) when she could have purchased the bundle (0,2), then we conclude that she finds (2,0) at least as good as the bundle (0,2) and prefers (2,0) to (0,1.9)

</div>
 
 
Given monotonicity, this implies that she must *strictly* prefer $a$ to $b$, i.e., $b \succ a$. We say that such a choice implies '$a$ is revealed strictly preferred to $b$.


Obviously, we cannot have that both $b \succsim a$  and $b \succ a$.  Thus, either she is not choosing rationally, or she is indifferent between $a$ and $b$ and her preferences are not monotonic.

***

\

**From O-R:**

First they define 'revealed preferred' and 'Revealed to be better than'



```{block2,  type='def'}

'Revealed at least as good'

> Given the demand function $x$, the bundle $a$ is *revealed to be at least as
good* as the bundle $b$ if for some prices $(p_1, p_2)$ and wealth $w$ the budget
set $B((p_1, p_2), w)$ contains both $a$ and $b$ , and $x((p_1, p_2), w) = a$ . 


\

'Revealed to be better than'

> The bundle $a$ is *revealed to be better than b* if for some prices *(p_1, p_2)* and wealth $w$ the budget set $B((p_1, p_2), w)$ contains both $a$ and $b$ , $p_1 b_1 + p_2 b_2 < w$, and $x((p_1, p_2), w) = a$ .



```  


\
Next, the WARP is stated simply:

```{block2,  type='def'}

> A demand function satisfies the weak axiom of revealed preference (WARP) if for no bundles a and b, both a is revealed to be at least as good as b and b is revealed to be better than a .

```  

\

Finally, they state and prove that this is a necessary condition for a demand function of a rational consumer (with monotonicity):

```{block2,  type='def'}

> A demand function that is rationalized by a monotone preference relation
satisfies the weak axiom of revealed preference.

```  

\

The proof of this is fairly simple (not covered here because of time and space concerns).


\

```{block2,  type='note'}

We can extend the WARP to 'chains' of revealed preference, so called 'indirect revealed preferences'  This allows us to use sequences of choices to sketch out indifference curves for actual consumers. 

There are also interesting ways to measure the 'extent' of violations of the revealed preference axioms. See:

## Properties of (Marshallian) demand functions {#demand-prop}

This material is presented at a less advanced level than the previous material. I imagine for many of you, this will be revision, and feel free to skim it or skip it. More advanced material is considered further below.

```

\

Previously, we considered how consumption choices determined by utility functions/indifference curves and budget constraints.  We can now consider how an individual's choice of a good  varies with  each element of her budget constraint:  for income and the price of each good.


```{block2,  type='warning'}

The notation has changed here, to some extent.

```

<div class="marginnote">
 The OR notation is difficult to adapt here. I try to keep notation constant as much as possible. However, this could be seen as a good thing to get used to: in reading various papers in Economics, authors will use a variety of labels for variables and formats.
 </div>


We will refer to her 'quantity demanded of good X' function (or more simply, her 'demand function') as follows:


<br> 
$$Quantity \: of \: X \: demanded = d_x(P_X, P_Y, I; preferences)$$

\

### Homogeneity {-}

Homogenous (of degree zero) (demand) function
:      A function whose outcome value does not change when *all* arguments are changed *proportionally* is *homogenous of degree zero*


 

<br>

$d_X(P_X,P_Y,I)$ is homogenous of degree zero in its arguments.


<br>


Multiply all prices and income by the same amount, and the *budget constraint is unchanged.*  Thus (as preferences have not changed) consumption choices should not change either.

-  E.g., the budget constraint $P_X X + P_Y Y = I$ is the same as the budget constraint $2P_X X + 2P_Y Y = 2I$

### Response to income changes

```{block2,  type='inputq'}

Q: What happens to the quantity purchased of some good as an individual's income increases?

```

\

```{block2,  type='fold'}

A: It depends on the preferences (i.e, the utility function, i.e., the relative curvature of the indifference curve at various points).

This defines whether the good is "normal" or "inferior."

Whether it is normal or inferior depends on your preferences and the change in the slope of the indifference curves with higher income/utility, as we see below.)

```
\



<br>

#### Defining a normal and inferior good {-}

Normal good
:     A good that is bought in *greater* quantities as income increases.

Inferior good
:     A good that is bought in *smaller* quantities as income increases.

\

-->

*Consider:* Here we see more income $\rightarrow$ less expenditure on Z! (Not just 'a lesser share' but actually *less*.)

This is because the *shape* of the indifference curves changes at higher incomes in this example.
When people have a lot to spend, they want to spend it on Y and not on Z. (Again *in this example*, not in general.)

Consider, if you won the lottery how much pot noodle would you buy? Pot noodle may be like good Z  in this example.

<br>

Thinking in 3d: 'as you walk up this hill, its ridge gradually moves to the west'.

```{block2,  type='note'}

To be precise, this is *not* about wealthy people being different than poor people
nor that their taste 'changes' when they become wealthy.

We are considering the same person with higher income,
and thus the potential to choose a different bundle of goods.

Empirically, these are hard to distinguish, however.

```
\

```{block2,  type='inputq'}
Consider: all goods cannot be inferior. Why not?
```

```{block2,  type='fold'}
There are 'adding up' conditions.

You always spend all of your income. Thus, if as your income increases, you spend less on some subset of goods,
you *must* spend more on the remaining goods.

```


### Response to (own) price changes (limited coverage) {#price_changes}

```{block2,  type='inputq'}

What happens to an individual's demand for a good as the price of this good rises, in our model? (I.e., if people are optimizing and their preferences obey all of the above axioms.)

```

```{block2,  type='fold'}

You might have thought that when price rises quantity demanded falls, and vice versa, the so-called "iron law of demand".

However, we cannot derive this from our model and in fact, when price rises, an optimizing  consumer might  demand more of this good or less of this good, we do not know!

If the good is *inferior* (as defined above) there will be  two  countervailing effects:

1. "Substitution effect":  Is a good (say, good 'X', on the X-axis) becomes more expensive, the budget line rotates (inward), and the point of tangency (where the price ratio equals the marginal rate of substitution) on *any* indifference curve moves towards a point with less of good X.  In other words, 'along a particular indifference curve'  the individual "substitutes away" from X as it becomes more expensive.

2. "Income effect": As X becomes more expensive, the individual's budget set is restricted. The individual is "poorer in a sense".  If X is an inferior good (in this region), this consumer, being 'poorer'  chooses consume *more* of the good, all else equal.

If the second effect outweighs the first we have the surprising result that , and we label such a good a "Giffen good".

```

To cover this in more detail, we would need to define another concept called "Hicksian demand" (see [supplement](#dual)).


### Complements/substitutes; response to (other) price changes (limited coverage) {#price_changes}

## Consumer surplus (brief and incomplete treatment)

Consumer surplus (Undergraduate definition: Nicholson and Snyder)
:     The extra value individuals receive from consuming a good over what they pay for it.

<br> \bigskip

- What people would be willing to pay for the *right* to consume a good *at its current price* rather than not being able to buy it at all.\*

<div class="marginnote">
In other words, if you said to a consumer 'this product will stop being produced/offered  unless you pay us enough money',  this is the maximum amount the consumer would be willing to pay to keep the product on the market,  at its current price.
 </div>


- The area between the demand curve and the market price

- A measure of consumer welfare, useful for policy analysis (unfold for some policy applications)


```{block2,  type='fold'}

Policy, e.g.,

- Impact of a tax or subsidy

- Impact of allowing firms to merge

- Impact of allowing a new form of price discrimination via (e.g.) 'internet cookies'

This concept can also be applied to measuring the value added by the introduction of a new good. This is useful to know for policy, particular in formulating subsidies for R\&D and in adjusting the CPI. It also could be used to compute damages in court cases where a firm is accused of stifling innovation.

```


\

```{r  fig.cap = 'Source: Nicholson and Snyder, 2010', out.width='80%', fig.asp=.5, fig.align='center',  echo = FALSE}
 knitr::include_graphics(file.path("picsfigs","cons_surplus.png"))
```


\

Also... This can be applied to the individual or market demand curve to obtain individual or total consumer surplus (although there are some technical issues with the latter).

\


```{block2,  type='technote'}

**Warning: The above is not precisely correct,** it is an 'undergraduate simplification'.  This measure of of consumer surplus is not a great measure of welfare changes in response to changes in prices (or taxes). Some issues in the fold below.

Other measures of changes in consumer welfare include 'equivalent variation' and 'compensating variation' (neither of which we will have time to cover in 2020).

```

```{block2,  type='fold'}


1. Income effects: If we are using an individual demand curve ... The consumer's Marshallian ('regular') demand response as the price changes reflects both *income and substitution effects*.

To determine either:

- the amount a consumer would be willing to pay to avoid a price change', *equivalent variation*,  or

- 'the amount a consumer would need to be compensated to be no worse off after a price change', the *compensating variation*

... we would need to know her 'Hicksian' or 'utility-compensated' demand curve; this is difficult or impossible to estimate.

\

2. Aggregation: To get consumer surplus we want to sum the value *each* consumer gets from each unit. Suppose, as we derive/assume under perfect competition, firms are pricing at the marginal cost of the final unit produced. Assume that cost varies over time, so we observe shifts in the supply curve, tracing out points on the demand curve. This allows us to estimate a market demand curve. But this demand curve (inverted) only tells us the *last* consumer's value of (willingness-to pay for) the final unit produced. We don't know how other consumers valued each of these units.

```




With a linear demand curve this is a triangle, which has an area that is easy to compute. More generally, this is a 'definite integral'.


<br> \bigskip


$$\int_{0}^{q^\ast}p(q)-p^\ast dq $$

(where $p(q)$ is the inverse demand).

<br> \bigskip

For welfare calculations, we often want to know 'how does this integral change as we adjust some parameter'?

$\rightarrow$ See the [(more general version of) the Leibniz rule for differentiating integrals.](https://brilliant.org/wiki/differentiate-through-the-integral/), related to the 'Fundamental theorem of calculus'.



<br> \bigskip

## Market demand (function) (brief and incomplete treatment)  {#mktdemand}

Market demand (or better, 'market quantity demanded')
:     The total quantity of a good or service demanded by all potential buyers

This just sums the individual quantities demanded (at a given price)


<br> \bigskip


Market demand curve
:     Relationship between total quantity demanded of a good and its price, ceteris paribus

```

<!--
LC: Illustrate 'sums horizontally' on visualiser if possible*

Some of our previous results about individual demand also hold for market demand, while others do not, or only if we make restrictive assumptions.


\

Shifts in the market demand curve are caused by similar things that cause individual demand curve shifts

- Increases in overall income (for normal goods)
- Reduced prices of complements, increased price of substitute goods
- Change in tastes

```{block2,  type='technote'}

However, the aggregate income does not have a single effect; it cannot be easily reduced to a single variable here. You can only express the demand curve as a function of aggregate income under restrictive assumptions. In general, it depends *who* gets this income. (See 'aggregation issues').

```

(In addition, the market demand curve could shift out if more consumers enter the market, e.g., because of demographic change.)

## Elasticities

<div class="marginnote">
This is a fundamental mathematics concept that comes from Physics;  it's not just for Economics.
</div>
 

- the change in quantity demanded of oranges when the price of oranges rises or
- the change in quantity demanded of apple juice when the price of apple juice rises?

`r format_with_col("(Or the response to changes in the price of a related good, or to income.)","gray")`

Difficulty: These things are measured in different *units* and the prices have different starting values.

<br> \bigskip

**Elasticity:** the measure of the \% change in one variable brought about by a 1\% change in another variable.

- a *unitless* measure; will be the same no matter how these variables are measured.

`r format_with_col("Think of *responsiveness* when talking about elasticity. Actually it's a measure from physics having to do with rubber bands, they tell me.","gray")`


```{block2,  type='note'}

Strictly speaking we are talking about the limit of these responses, i.e., derivatives. \

The elasticity is basically the derivative of $ln(y)$ with respect to $ln(x)$; useful to know if you want to run a regression computing an elasticity, or if you want to interpret such a regression.

Actually, this, and its subtleties and interpretations is one of the *most* important things to comprehend for empirical work!!

```

<br> \bigskip

- If a 5\% fall in the price of oranges typically results in a 10\% increase in quantity bought,
- we say that each percent fall in the price of oranges leads to an increase in sales of about 2 percent.
- I.e., the ‘‘elasticity’’ of orange sales with respect to price is about 2,

*Note that elasticities may not be constant*; they may depend on the starting point;  e.g., linear demand implies a different price elasticity at each point.

\

### Elasticities more precisely {-}

- calculate in terms of derivatives

- estimated using log transformations\* 

(There is a decent video explaining how to interpret these regressions [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73jA1PG9B0Y), and another one [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXBFKKh54Es) but you need to recall what is meant by 'total differentiation'.)

<div class="marginnote">
\* But see Santos-Silva’s 2006 warning about this.

</div>
 

\

### Price elasticity of demand

**Price elasticity of demand:**

$$e_{Q_d,p} = \frac{percent \ change \ in \ Q_d}{percent \ change \ in \ p} $$
$$  = \frac{\Delta Q_d}{Q_d}/\frac{\Delta p}{p}$$

This should always be negative (except for Giffen goods).

It is a *unitless measure* related to the slope of the demand curve.

It is *very* important for price-setting firms (more on this later).


\

**From Nicholson and Snyder, 2010 (footnote):**

If demand happens to take the 'constant elasticity' form $Q = ap^b$ where $b<0$, the price elasticity of demand is $b$.

<div class="marginnote">
The constant-elasticity form is derived from the 'constant elasticity' using the method of 'ordinary differential equations'.
</div>
 

- This elasticity is the same everywhere along such a demand curve.

- Taking logarithms of this yields $ln(q) = ln(a) + b ln(p)$

- note that elasticities are often estimated by regressing logs on logs

> 'The last time we had to increase prices (which was in 2010 when cotton prices soared) we estimated that price elasticity was around 1.1. If that remains the case today, a retail selling price increase of 5% would result in a fall in unit sales of -5.5% and a fall in like for like sales value of between -0.5% to -1.0%. In the scheme of things, we think that this drag on sales is manageable and less damaging than taking a significant hit to margin.'



\

### Properties of price elasticity of demand 

- Goods with many close substitutes at a similar price will be highly elastic
-  with few substitutes ...  inelastic
- Typically: more elastic in the *long run* than the short run. `r format_with_col("Q : why?","blue")`

```{block2,  type='fold'}
Ans: Over time, consumers can adjust to price changes by changing their consumption patterns. E.g., if petrol gets more expensive I can switch to a hybrid or electric car, or a bicycle.
```


<br>

<!---
Todo: give more explanation here
-->

We refer to price elasticities with the following terminology:

$e_{Q,p}$ | $abs(e_{Q,p})$ | Term         |
|-----------|-------------|--------------|
| $< -1$    | $>1$        | Elastic      |
| $= -1$    | $=1$        | Unit Elastic |
| $> -1$    | $<1$        | Inelastic    |


<div class="marginnote">
Note that sometimes elasticities are expressed in absolute value terms (a positive number). It should be clear from the context.
</div>


\

Consider an individual's  expenditure on a product.

The total expenditure (which will equal the firms' revenue from this): price $\times$ quantity = Expenditure ($E$)


By taking the *total differential* of this  and recalling the 'multiplication rule' of derivatives...

$$E = p(q)q  = pq(p)$$
$$dE = pq'(p)dp+q(p)dp$$
$$dE/E = \frac{pq'(p)dp}{pq} +\frac{q(p)dp}{pq}$$
$$dE/E = \frac{q'(p)dp}{q} +\frac{dp}{p}$$

\

We have that for *small changes* in price, the percent *change* in total expenditure is:

**percent change in price + percent change in quantity**

\

As $e_{Q,P}$ tells you the percent change in quantity for each (small) percentage change in price, we can use this to determine the change in expenditure for a small change in price.

\

*Considering very small increases in a good's price:*


-   If the (individual's) demand is *price-elastic*,  quantity will decrease by a *larger* percentage than price increased.  Thus her expenditure (on this good) will *decline*.

-   If the (individual's) demand is *price-inelastic*,  quantity will decrease by a *smaller* percentage than price increased.  Thus her expenditure (on this good) will *increase *.

-   If the (individual's) demand is *unit-elastic* (with respect to price),  quantity will decrease by a *the same* percentage as price increased.  Thus her expenditure (on this good) will *be unchanged*.

<br>



#### Example and algebra... {-}

If price rises by 20\% and quantity demanded falls by 20\% what happens to revenue?

\

Suppose $p=10$ and $q=10$ so $TR=100$. Then when p=12 and q=8 TR=96. Huh? Price increased by 20\% and quantity decreased by 20\% so shouldn't TR be unchanged?  No! This only works for small changes.

\


TR is unchanged when $p \times q$ stays the same. With a change in each $\delta p$ and $\delta q$, the new revenue is

$(p+\delta p)(q+\delta q) = pq+\delta p q + \delta q p + \delta p \delta q$.

\

This is the same as before if $pq=pq+\delta p q + \delta q p + \delta p \delta q$, i.e., if

$\delta p q + \delta q p + \delta p \delta q=0$, i.e., if

$\delta p q + \delta p \delta q =-\delta q p$, i.e., if

$\delta p q/p + \delta p \delta q/p =-\delta q$, i.e., if

$\delta p/ \delta q (q/p) + \delta p /p =-1$, i.e., if

$-e_p +  \delta p /p = -1$

In the limit, as  $\delta p$ goes to zero, this gives us that 'unit elasticity means a small change in quantity leads to no change in revenue.'


\

**Important question/result**

```{block2,  type='inputq'}

Q: Suppose a firm is setting its price and selling to only one individual , and facing no  competitors. It should basically never want to set its price at a point where demand is inelastic. Why not?

```

```{block2,  type='fold'}

Ans: If it were at such a point, it could raise its price and its revenue would increase and costs would decline  (because it would be selling fewer products but for greater total revenue.)


<div class="marginnote">
[*Consider*](https://twitter.com/GivingTools/status/1293117069114912768?s=20)

- If I want to get to the highest point on a mountain, do I locate at a point with an 'upward slope'? 

- I.e., do I choose a point where "if I move in some direction, I go higher"? 
   
This is a key point, but also a common point of confusion. The point is the principle of (what I will call) 'no room for improvement'. If I am at an optimal point I can do no better. Thus if I can do better, I must not be at an optimal point.  

If the firm can increase its profits by increasing its price relative to its current price, then its current price is not profit-maximising.

\
A caveat is that it might do this for a long term strategic advantage; e.g., to gain customer loyalty and market share, intending to take its profits later.  We come back to a related point later in the context of monopoly pricing.

### Some real-world discussion of this {-}

Todo: give more explanation here

[Prof. Muellbauer letter to FT](https://www.ft.com/content/4ea79d96-a4d6-11e5-a91e-162b86790c58)

> Sir, Professor Gordon Gemmill (Letters, December 14), surprisingly for a trained economist, assumes an income elasticity of demand of zero for housing: that is, that people do not demand more and better housing as they become richer. Nowhere in the world is this the case! My own empirical work demonstrates that around two-thirds of the rise in UK house prices, corrected for general inflation, since 1980 is because supply is not keeping up with income and population growth. Other drivers do exist ... The price effects of extra supply take time to build up. I agree on that. But just imagine what would happen if we did nothing more than we are now doing: population and income growth would drive prices even higher even though we already hold the record for rises in house prices since 1970 among the group of seven leading high-income countries. We need to build far more housing, in the right locations. And we need to start now.

## More formal statements of properties of Marshallian demand {#formal_demand}

<div class="marginnote">

</div>


Note: *bold* means 'vectors'.

\


Budget set

$$B=\{\mathbf{q} \in R^n_{+}|\mathbf{p'q} \leq I \}$$

Slopes $dq_i/dq_j|_B = -p_j/p_i$.
in
Consumer chooses $\mathbf{x}(\mathbf{p},I)\in B$; Marshallian demands.

\
The graph of $x_i(\mathbf{p},I)$ in $I$ is the 'Engel curve'. The Engel curve simply depicts how quantity demanded of one good increases in (an individual's) income, holding all else constant.

\

Graphing the Engel curve (some links):

```{block2,  type='fold'}

Some decent youtube videos on this, in a simple form.

We see the graphical derivation of an Engel curve: 

- For a neccesity (i.e., a non-luxury) good [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh6RvLH7Q1Q&t=27s)

- for a normal good (remember, an inferior good is also a neccesity, but not necessarily vice versa) [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jQNvDq29Tg).

- And for a luxury good [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kPRjGuOwMsc&t=114s) (remember, a luxury good is also a normal good, but not necessarily vice versa)


He presents the indifference curves and then 'Income consumption curve'... the optimizing choice of each of two goods as income increases. Next, he plots this for one good only, yielding the 'Engel curve'. 

Notice how the Engel curve gets steeper for a necessary good, but gets shallower for a luxury good. For an inferior good, it has a negative slope.

Of course the response to changes in income need not be constant throughout the whole range ... a good can even be inferior in one range and luxury within another range of income.

```

\

<div class="marginnote">

See Professor Joon Song's video [HERE](https://www.dropbox.com/s/8dgknj0rkkrnvq0/joon_income_expansion_path_engel_curve_income_elasticity.mp4?dl=0) for an integrated presentation of the income expansion path, the Engel Curve, and income elasticity.

</div>
 
\

*Total budget (income) elasticity:*

$$\eta_i \equiv \frac{\partial x_i}{\partial I} / \frac{x_i}{I}  = \frac{\partial ln(x_i)}{\partial ln(I)} $$

'By what percentage does consumption of $x_i$ change as income changes by a small percent?'

- $\eta_i > 0$ $\rightarrow$ 'normal good', otherwise 'inferior'

\

Applying this to 'budget shares': $s_i \equiv p_i x_i/I$... noting these must add up to one: $\sum_{i=1..n}s_i=1$

- $\eta_i > 1$ $\rightarrow$ 'luxury' (budget share rises in income), otherwise 'neccessity'

\


```{block2,  type='inputq'}

Can you write the 'own price elasticity' in this notation?
   
```  

```{block2,  type='fold'}

Similarly, ...

$\epsilon_i \equiv \frac{\partial x_i}{\partial p_j} / \frac{x_i}{p_j} $

```

\


## Adding-up ('aggregation') etc {#aggregation}

If an individual 'always spends all her income' then this equality must hold everywhere.  This implies a set of relationships:

- between how things *change* in response to income and price...
  -as one spends more on one good she must spend less on another

- between *shares* of expenditure and how these change.


Rewriting the budget constraint with the Marshallian demands vector $\mathbf{x}$, and imposing budget-balance (which can be proved must hold for an optimising consumer given local nonsatiation):

$$\mathbf{p'x}(\mathbf{p},I) = I$$

\


<div class="marginnote">
TODO: I hope to include a video here
</div>


Differentiating this wrt $I$ yields **Engel aggregation**:


$$\sum_i p_i \frac{\partial x_i}{\partial I} =\sum_i \frac{p_i x_i}{I} \frac{\frac{\partial x_i}{\partial I}}{\frac{x_i}{I}} =\sum_i s_i\eta_i = 1$$

$\rightarrow$ Sum (over all goods) of 'budget share' $\times$ 'income elasticity' must add up to one.

\

Thus not all goods can be inferior ($\epsilon_i < 0$); these must be balanced by normal goods (including some luxuries, to get the average above one.)

\

Also not all goods can be luxuries ($\epsilon_i > 1$) and not all goods can be necessities ($\epsilon_i < 1$). These must balance each other out, in an expenditure-weighted sense.
\

Differentiating the 'demand budget constraint wrt some price $p_i$ yields *Cournot aggregation*:

(rem: product rule here, carried through sums )

$$x_j + \sum_i p_i \frac{\partial x_i}{\partial p_j} = 0 \rightarrow$$
The marginal change in expenditure as $j$'s price changes sums the amount of $j$ originally purchased and the sum of the prices of other goods times their responses to the price change in j.

Next we multiply this by the price of j and divide by income $I$ to get (bunch of steps here:)

$$ -s_j = \sum s_i \epsilon_{ij} $$

The budget share on j plus the sum of the budget shares of other goods multiplied by the cross-price elasticities must add up to 0. ... as the price of j increases the price-weighted consumption shares must decrease.  So, e.g., all goods cannot be Giffen.

## Enrichment, further material to consider

1. To consider **constrained optimization** (with many goods) using the Lagrangian method  see [THIS supplement](#lagrange) (based on David Autor's notes)

2. The dual 'minimization problem' and 'Hicksian demand' are discussed [HERE](#dual). For a simpler treatment, please see QMC Chapter 20.3\*.

### Further doctoral-prep concepts {-#docprep}

*Some examples of things you may need to learn and use for a PhD micro module, (although only a small subset of economists actually use this in their research!). You will not be directly examined on this in the present module. Some of these are covered or touched on in O-R*

```{block2,  type='fold'}

Another taste, nice [UCLA notes here](http://www.econ.ucla.edu/iobara/LecturePreferenceandUtility201A.pdf)

\

As noted, standard utility functions are defined up to 'monotonic transformations'. We can derive proofs of the invariance of the implied preferences to these.

\


What conditions on a (multivariate) utility function ensure it exhibits the equivalent of a *diminishing marginal rates of substitution*?
    - Something called 'quasi-concavity', equivalent to 'having convex upper contour sets'



Representation of the MRS between all goods as a matrix, depicting the properties of this

- Strict quasi-concavity takes the place of DMRS in ensuring 'simple optimisation conditions'


\


**Several topics that we have skipped**

- Formal definitions of Hicksian (compensated) demand functions

- Substitution and income effects

- Deriving and using the Slutsky decomposition relating Marshallian and Hicksian demand, -  a set of other exact relationships between functions that come out of the consumer's minimisation and equivalent maximisation problem



<div class="marginnote">
Some of these concepts are important for characterizing the welfare effects of price changes and policy changes (including taxation), and for conceptualizing issues involving multiple constraints on consumer optimization (e.g., rationing). I will provide notes on these for anyone who is interested.

\

Notes on O-R chapter:

```{block2,  type='fold'}

We will focus on the (standard) profit-maximisation goal, although their discussion of other goals is interesting.

They define consumer and producer surplus here to give a brief treatment of the deadweight loss of monopoly.

They also have a very interesting treatment of the two main types of price discrimination; 'Implicit discrimination' foreshadows asymmetric information and agency problems.

There are various names of each of these ... I am familiar with "second degree  = self-selection" and "third degree or 'explicit segmentation'". They call the latter 'Implicit discrimination.

## Why study the monopoly?

A *monopoly* is a single firm operating in a market without competition.

Although this is an extreme situation (the opposite extreme to 'perfect competition'), we focus on this because:

- The mathematics of the quantity/pricing choices are easy to interpret, and relevant to other environments.

<div class="marginnote">
E.g., the optimization is equivalent to the case of 'monopolistic competition', which is sometimes argued to be the most realistic benchmark framework. In 'monopolistic competition', each firm has a somewhat differentiated product (or 'location') and faces a downward sloping demand for its own product.  However, with monopolistic competition, unlike under monopoly, as more firms selling related products enter, each firm's profit dissipates to zero.
</div>

- It provides a simple example of the "deadweight" welfare loss from firms with market power reducing their supply in order to keep up prices.

- We can most simply percent models of price discrimination and segmentation, which is a highly relevant business practice (and may face similar concerns in other competitive environments like monopolistic competition)

- Monopolies (or near-monopolies) certainly do exist and have always existed in some industries ... And perhaps these are growing even more important (consider the "big 4 tech firms")

\

## Monopoly profit-maximisation: simple (undergraduate-level) take:

As noted, a *monopoly* is a single firm operating in a market without competition.

\


Such a firm may gain an *Economic Profit* \*.

<div class="marginnote">
An economic profit is the revenue minus costs, where the costs *include* normal returns to the capital invested in the project. You should be clear on this basic and fundamental (undergraduate) concept.
 </div>


\

A monopoly situation can only be sustained by some [barriers to entry](#barriers), discussed below.

\


A monopoly firm, like all firms, will set it's quantity $Q$ to maximize it's profits $\pi(Q) \equiv QP(Q)-C(Q)$ where $P(Q)$ is the inverse demand (the maximum price that can be charged if a firm wants to sell quantity $Q$), and $C(Q)$ is the cost of producing $Q$.

\

Under standard simple conditions (discussed below), if the monopoly can only charge a single price, this  leads to the monopoly maximising it's profit by producing $Q$ such that $MR(Q) = MC(Q)$ (assuming $P>AC$).

This is because under these simple conditions, we simply need to take the 'first order condition' ... i.e., to find the profit-maximising quantity $$argmax_{Q} \Big(QP(Q)-C(Q)\Big),$$
we simply find the unique point where the slope in $Q$ (the derivative) is zero, so $$P(Q)+QP'(Q) - C'(Q) = 0,$$ i.e.,
$$P(Q)+QP'(Q) =  C'(Q)$$, i.e., again, $MR(Q) = MC(Q)$.


\

Marginal revenue is the rate at which revenue $QP(Q)$ changes in quantity, which is thus $P(Q)+QP'(Q)$.


For a small increase in $Q$:

- The rectangle of revenue increases proportionally to the current price,
- but it decreases at rate $P'(Q)$ as price must decrease to sell the next unit, and this price decrease reduces revenue in proportion to the current quantity $Q$. For my money, this example offers the most intuitive example of the product rule for derivatives.

\

Intuition:  the 'volume' benefit of increasing $Q$ is countered by

1. a greater cost (producing more always costs more) and
2. the need to reduce price (on all units) to get people to buy it.

\

For a linear demand curve the marginal revenue will have a slope of twice of the inverse demand curve, and the same intercept (see computation below). See [HERE](https://youtu.be/IEjcTLPtTIY) for a very simple and clear depiction of monopoly profit maximization with a linear demand curve (and only a bit of oversimplification.)


```{block2,  type='fold'}

Suppose $Q = \alpha - \frac{1}{\beta} P$, so
$P = \alpha\beta - \beta Q$

Then revenue is $PQ = \alpha\beta Q - \beta Q^2$ so
$MR =  \alpha\beta - 2\beta Q$, as noted, twice the slope of the inverse demand curve

```

The firm's *profit* is this revenue less average cost. \

MR tells you how the 'revenue rectangle' will increase (or decrease) with another unit. MC tells you the *cost* of this additional unit. \

### 'There is no supply curve for a monopoly!'

A  'Supply curve': maps from p to q (and usually vice-versa) for a firm or industry. This is not *affected* by demand, only by the costs and number of firms.


<br>


*In contrast:*

A monopoly *chooses* price (thus also choosing quantity it can sell) where $MR(q)=mc(q)$.

- But $MR(q)$ depends on the demand curve slope/curvature at $q$,
- so if the demand curve changes it will affect the supply/pricing decision!


## Monopolistic market, profit-maximization: O-R formal depiction and advanced insights

O-R formally define a monopolistic market.  Their definition and approach is unusual because:

<div class="marginnote">
Note that they are defining the 'primitives' of such a market in a way that allows one to apply rigorous math proofs and (potentially) define an 'equilibrium'.
</div>

1. They incorporate, from the beginning, a demand function $q_i(p_i)$ for each 'segment' $i$ ... allowing for the possibility of price discrimination (something which we will focus on).

2. They let the producer have a 'preference' ($\succsim$), which may incorporate both profit and quantities sold in each segment. We will not focus on this: we will focus on the standard profit-maximisation goal.

<div class="marginnote">
This second point is very interesting, but we've no time to address it now.
</div>


```{block2,  type='def'}

**Monopolistic market**

> A monopolistic market $\langle (q_i)^k_i=1, C, \succsim  \rangle$  for a single good has the following components:
```

\


They are just specifying the 'objects defining a monopolistic market' here; they have not told us what these things are yet.

<div class="marginnote">
Note that we are focusing on a producer of a *single* good; more complex cases could involve multiple goods with production synergies, strategic bundling, etc.
</div>


```{block2,  type='def'}

OR continue:

> **Demand**

> The function $q_i$, the demand function in segment $i$, associates with every price $p_i$ for segment $i$ the total amount $q_i(p_i)$ of the good demanded in that segment.
```

\

They note that these demand functions are 'decreasing' functions: for higher values of the argument, the output of the function is *not* higher. In other words, we are considering demand functions that are decreasing, or at least not increasing, in price.\*

<div class="marginnote">
 This rules out the 'Giffen' good.
</div>


```{block2,  type='def'}

OR:

> **Producer**
> A single producer, called a monopolist, characterized by a cost function $C$ that is continuous and convex and satisfies $C(0) = 0$,


> and a preference relation $\succsim$ over pairs $((y_1,... , y_k), \pi)$, where $y_i$ is the quantity sold in segment $i$ for $i = 1,..., k$ and $\pi$ is the producer’s profit

```

\

Note that cost increases in output at an increasing rate; this is a fairly restrictive assumption, and it rules out the 'natural monopoly' case.  They also assume that the cost of producing 0 is 0, which seems natural.

\

### Profit maximization and marginal revenue


O-R Essentially restate the analysis we presented above, however they are slightly more formal, and they consider an interesting wrinkle: marginal revenue *need not be decreasing* in quantity.


\
O-R definitions ...

> Let $\langle (q_i)^k_i=1, C, \succsim  \rangle$ be a uniform-price monopolistic market.

...we refer to 'uniform pricing', because here (as above) we are considering only a single price for the market as a whole. We discuss [below](#arbitrage) why price discrimination my not always be possible, for legal or practical reasons.

\

> Define the total demand function $Q$ by $Q(p)=\sum_{i=1}^k q_i(p)$

... simply summing the quantity demanded at a certain price across all segments 1 through k.

\

O-R Define marginal revenue essentially as above,

> $MR(y) = [P(y)y]' = P(y) + P'(y)y$, where P is the inverse of Q.

giving additional intuition ...

> If the function P is decreasing, ...

(i.e., if the demand curve slopes downwards)

> ..we have $MR(y) ≤ P(y)$ for all y. [Because] selling an additional unit of the good increases revenue by approximately $P(y)$ but also causes a reduction in the price of all $y$ units sold.

<div class="marginnote">
I restate this point because it's just that important.
</div>

\

They next make an interesting point which I have not seen noted before:

> Usually the function MR is assumed to be decreasing, but this property does not follow from the assumptions we have made. The derivative of $MR$ at $y$ is $2P′(y) + P′′(y)y$

<div class="marginnote">
Of course the MR is itself the derivative of the revenue function, so here we are considering the *derivative of a derivative*.  I.e., the derivative of $P(y) + P'(y)$ with respect to $Y$ ... and thus considering, 'Is the rate at which revenue *increases* in output decreasing as output increases, so additional units of output add less to revenue than earlier units? This was the case in all the graphs depicted above, but it need not hold in general.
</div>


> so that if $P′′(y)$ is positive and large enough, the derivative is positive even if $P$ is decreasing.

We assumed above that price is decreasing in quantity (only ruling out 'Giffen goods'). Thus as the quantity increases the *benefit* of an additional unit of increase in quantity (holding price constant) must be smaller, because you are charging a lower price. This by itself would point to a declining MR.

\

However, for every increase in quantity the price must fall somewhat, which itself reduces revenue. The necessary marginal drop in price $P'(y)$ need not be constant, it may be increasing or decreasing, i.e., $P′′(y)$ may be positive or negative in any region. Thus, it's possible that for increases in quantity from a *larger* starting quantity, the necessary reduction in price is relatively much *smaller* than it was when increasing quantity from a smaller base, leading to a lower loss of revenue than before, and even outweighing the effect in the previous paragraph.


This is illustrated in O-R example 7.1 involving 'unit demand' rather than a continuous demand function, depicting three consumers with 'maximum willingness to pay' of 10, 6, and 5, respectively:

| y 	| p 	| rev(y) 	| mr(y) 	|
|-	|-	|-	|-	|
| 1 	| 10 	| 10 	| 10 	|
| 2 	| 6 	| 12 	| 2 	|
| 3 	| 5 	| 15 	| 3 	|


\

Above, we see that increasing the quantity $y$ from 1 to 2 requires reducing price from £10 to £6, and thus increasing revenue by only £2. However, increasing the quantity from 2 to 3 requires reducing price by only £1 further, and thus increasing revenue by £3. Although the latter price decrease 'operates on more prior units' (2 rather than 1), it is a much smaller price decrease (£1 reduction rather than a £4 reduction), outweighing the 'volume effect'.

*Explaining O-R notation for example 7.1 in response to a student question*:

```{block2,  type='fold'}

Student:

> how [did] they 'derive' $MR(y ) = P(y )y − P(y − 1)(y − 1)$, for the indivisible good. I understand how to reach definition 7.3 but am stuck applying it to this example.

\

*Teacher:*

Yes -- I think you might be misunderstanding the definition or notation.


$P(.)$ is a function here, the inverse demand. So $P(y)$ tells me 'how much can I charge at most, and still sell $y$ units'.

They *define* $MR$ as 'the increase in revenue when I sell one more unit'.

- Sell 0 units -- 0 revenue.
- Sell 1 unit, can charge at most £10 ... so $P(1)=10$, and $Revenue(1) =  P(1) \times 1 = 10 \times 1=10$

- Sell 2 units, can charge at most 6, so $P(2) = 6$, and $Revenue(2) =  P(2)\times  2 = 6 \times 2=12$

Thus, by their definition, $MR(y) = P(y)y −P(y −1)(y −1)$,
we have $MR(2)=P(2) \times 2 - P(2-1)\times(2-1) = 6 \times 2 - 10 \times 1 = 12-10 = 2$


(Also $MR(2) = Revenue(2) - Revenue(1)$).

```

\

The fact that $MR$ need not be everywhere downward sloping means that the $MR(y)=MC(y)$ condition for profit maximizing output $y$ is a necessary condition but not a sufficient condition.\*

<div class="marginnote">
\* This is not a 'corner solution' issue: it is not even sufficient for an *interior* optimum, with a positive output. Furthermore, this is not because of regions of decreasing marginal costs; it is not sufficient even if MC are constant or rising everywhere.
</div>

O-R illustrate this point in Figure 7.1. *Have a look*.

\

### "Lerner markup rule" -- an additional insight {#lerner}

From McDL:

> We can rearrange the monopoly pricing formula to produce an additional insight.

(Going back to our earlier notation...)

A profit-maximizing monopolist must set $Q$ (if positive) such that:

$$P(Q)+QP'(Q) =  C'(Q).$$
Rearrange this to consider the 'markup over marginal cost':

$$P(Q) -  C'(Q) = -QP'(Q),$$
and now as the 'markup as a fraction of the price charged', the so-called 'Lerner Index':

$$\frac{P(Q) -  C'(Q)}{P(Q)} = -\frac{QP'(Q)}{P(Q)}=\frac{1}{\epsilon} ,$$

The right hand side of this is simply the 'inverse price elasticity' $\frac{1}{\epsilon}$.

Derivation:

```{block2,  type='fold'}

Take the inverse of the second term

$\frac{1}{-\frac{QP'(Q)}{P(Q)}}$
$=-\frac{\frac{1}{Q}{\frac{P'(Q)}{P(Q)}}$
$=-\frac{\frac{1}{Q}}{\frac{\frac{dP}{dQ}}{P(Q)}}$
$=-\frac{\frac{dQ}{Q}}{\frac{dP}{P}}$
$=\epsilon$

```

> this formula provides a measure of the deviation from competition, and in particular says that the deviation from competition is small when the elasticity of demand is large, and vice versa.

> ... If demand is very elastic, the effect of monopoly on prices is quite limited. In contrast, if the demand is relatively inelastic, monopolies will increase prices by a large margin.

\


This is also a formula firms might directly use ... if they knew their marginal cost and, more challengingly, if they knew the price elasticity of demand over its entire range. In the real world, firms do sometimes use 'markup rules' for pricing.

According to McDL:

> This formula is sometimes used to justify a “fixed markup policy,” which means a company adds a constant percentage markup to its products. This is an ill-advised policy not justified by the formula, because the formula suggests a markup which depends on the demand for the product in question and thus not a fixed markup for all products a company produces.

\

Some more insights from McDL:

```{block2,  type='fold'}

> Marginal cost will always be at least zero or larger.... Thus, the price-cost margin is no greater than one, and as a result, a monopolist produces in the elastic portion of demand.

DR: Note that I emphasze at great length that a monopolist will never price in the inelastic portion of the demand curve it faces, and I try to give lots of insight into this.

> One implication c ...  if demand is everywhere inelastic (e.g. $p(q) = q−a$ for $a>1$), the optimal monopoly quantity is essentially zero, and in any event would be no more than one molecule of the product.


```

## Monopolies and 'allocative inefficiency' {#monop-inef}

O-R:

> Since $MR(y)  < P(y)$ for all $y$, an implication of Proposition 7.1 [$MR(y^{\ast})=MC(y^{\ast})$] is that the price charged by a profit-maximizing producer in a uniform-price monopolistic market is greater than the marginal cost at this output.

This leads to an inefficiency:

> the cost of production of another unit of the good is less than the price that some buyers are willing to pay for the good. The monopolist does not produce the extra unit because he takes into account that the price reduction necessary to sell the extra unit will affect all the other units, too, causing his profit to fall.

\


```{block2,  type='note'}

Recall from your previous studies, the model of 'perfect competition':

Free entry and exit  $\rightarrow$ zero long-run economic profit

Many many tiny firms $\rightarrow$ firms are price takers.

$\rightarrow$ price = marginal cost, and in the long run $p=ATC$ and firms produce at $min(AC)$

Similar conditions for input markets (e.g., capital and labor).

This, in combination with firms and consumer's optimizing behavior, and several other assumed conditions (such as diminishing returns to scale) yielded the 'fundamental welfare theorems'. Under the first welfare theorem, free exchange and markets 'in equilibrium' lead to a Pareto-efficient outcome.

These were extreme assumptions; perhaps only a theoretical ideal.


\

In contrast, firms with market power might maximize their profits by setting $p>mc$.

A 'permanent unregulated monopoly firm' is the opposite extreme: A single firm, No possibility of competing firms entering, and no competitive or legal constraints on price.


```

<br>



<div class="marginnote">
There are a variety of *market structures* we might consider that fall in between the extremes of perfect competition and monopoly. These include 'oligopoly' and 'monopolistic competition'. The field of Industrial Organization focuses on these models of market structure  and their implications for pricing, welfare, innovation, and more
</div>


\

### The deadweight loss of monopoly: simple discussion {#dwl-simple}


*Criticisms of monopoly:*

1. Monopolies produce too little output, the standard 'deadweight loss triangle'. This leads to *allocative inefficiency* (i.e., top-level inefficiency, i.e., the wrong mix of goods is being produced; too little of the monopolized good and too much of other goods).

2. There is a redistribution of wealth from consumers to owners of monopoly.

(But the latter could be counterbalanced by government redistribution; so maybe we shouldn't consider it a strike against monopoly?)


\

Compared to perfect competition, a monopoly typically produces less output and charges a higher price

- Some of the consumer surplus under perfect competition is transferred to the monopolist.

- There is also a deadweight loss under monopoly, as depicted below. This 'deadweight' is lost to society--- no one gets it. It represents net value that *could* be generated but is *not* generated.

```{block2,  type='note'}

2020 BEEM101 students: For time concerns, I am not going to focus on the measures of the welfare cost or deadweight loss of monopoly, nor on the potential regulatory responses to reduce these costs. These are certainly important for economic policymaking, however. The stereotypical free-market economist is thought to argue that 'price ceilings are always harmful'; this is not necessarily the case.

```

\

### Aside: Types of inefficiency; simple definitions {-}

We refer to underprovision of monopoly as a departure from '**allocative inefficiency**' AKA '**top-level inefficiency'**.

\

Essentially, from the point of view of the entire economy:

1. If we could produce more of one good without producing less of any other good (i.e., we are below the 'production possibility frontier' (PPF)), perhaps because we are misallocating inputs to different production processes (e.g., capital and labor) ... this is called **Productive inefficiency**

<div class="marginnote">
Here 'goods' includes all things that people value, including services, environmental amenities, leisure time, etc.
</div>


2. Suppose the economy is producing the combination of goods yielding 'point Z on the PPF.'  However, suppose that given the combination of goods produced Z, and the distribution of these goods to consumers we could *reallocate* these.  (E.g., have person 1 trade good $z_1$ to person 2 in  exchange for some of good $z_2$). Suppose that this reallocation would  to make at least one person better off without making anyone worse off (a Pareto imrovement). Then the original point (before any such reallocation) was not Pareto Optimal; it suffered from **Exchange inefficiency**.


3. Suppose the economy is producing at 'Point X on the PPF' and there is no Exchange inefficiency. However, we are producing the 'wrong goods': we  could make a Pareto improvement by producing 'more of one good and less of another' (and allocating these to consumers).  We call this **'top-level inefficiency'** or **'allocative inefficiency'**. The DWL of monopoly leads to allocative inefficiency: too little of the monopolized good will be produced relative to other goods. (The remaining productive resources will presumably be used towards non-monopolized goods, and these will be relatively over-produced.)


\

### Other potential social costs and benefits of monopoly {#other_costs_monop}

Some argue the deadweight loss (DWL) above *understates* the true harm of monopoly. This is controversial. These arguments include...

- 'Secure' monopolies don't innovate as much, and spend wastefully (leading to productive inefficiency)?

- Monopolies may expend wasteful resources (lobbying, threats, lawsuits...) to preserve barriers to entry

Thus the above monopoly profits may turn into *further* deadweight losses!

On the other side, some people argue monopolies tend not to persist in the long run, are disciplined by *potential* entry, and have *greater* incentives to innovate.


\

Empirically, the magnitude of the social cost of monopoly is an open question. Estimates range from 0.5\% of GDP to 5\% of GDP

\


#### The double marginalisation problem {-#double-marg}

Note that if a monopoly firm buys its inputs from a supplier who is also a single-price monopolist, the welfare cost is compounded. There are then 'two markups' leading to even more inefficiency.

<center>

A simple depiction of the double-marginalisation problem.

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-uN--rvaGA4" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

</center>

Another simple presentation for the case of linear demand can be found [HERE](http://web.mit.edu/rpindyck/www/Courses/VS_11.pdf) on pages 1-6.

This is an argument for letting firms merge with their upstream supplier.

We return to this in the exercises.

\

```{block2,  type='inputq'}
*Consider also:* if a firm allows an 'upstream division' to charge a price for inputs to a 'downstream division' and the latter sets prices and quantities for retail sales... and both divisions 'keep their surpluses'... will this boost the firm's profits?
```

```{block2,  type='fold'}

This is called 'transfer pricing'. It may offer incentives to efficiently cut costs. However, by doing this, the firm may end up recreating the double-marginalisation problem, leading to inefficiency and lower profits. There is a tradeoff.
```

## Barriers to entry {#barriers}

If a monopoly firm is earning 'economic profits' (profits in excess of the normal risk-adjusted returns to capital), other firms will want to enter the industry.  Thus,  for the monopoly to persist there must be "barriers to entry".

```{block2,  type='inputq'}

What are some 'Technical barriers to entry'?

What are some 'Legal barriers to entry'? Explain.

What other barriers might exist?
```

\

**Technical barriers to entry**

```{block2,  type='fold'}


**1. Increasing returns to scale / Diminishing average cost over a broad range of output**  $\rightarrow$ 'a natural monopoly'

Here multiple firms producing separately are in fact *less efficient*, as they cannot produce the lowest cost.

\

**2. Special knowledge of a low-cost method of production, or a key resource**


<div class="marginnote">
\* However some argue that there will simply be a limited "rent" derived from this new production process, and it will not constitute a barrier to entry. How would you make such a case?
</div>

\

3. A limited market scale with fixed costs and 'indivisibilities.' E.g., demand for a particular river crossing may be such that it could support a single ferry operator making a profit, but not two ferry operators. Here there might be a 'first-mover advantage'.

```

\

```{block2,  type='fold'}

** Legal barriers to entry**

- Patents and copyrights
- Exclusive franchise or license (granted by government, by another firm, by a university)
- Government support for a dominant firm, discouraging/forbidding others

```

\

**Other proposed barriers: the threat of 'predation'**

```{block2,  type='fold'}

Economists have debated whether "predatory practices" could allow a firm to retain monopoly power. For example, a firm might commit "if any other firms enter we will reduce our prices far below cost." Perhaps this would scare away other firms from entering.

\

However, this might not be a "credible threat"; if another firm *did* enter, the would-be-monopolist might not find it profitable to retaliate in this way. This is an open question; the game theoretic prediction depends on the assumptions made.

```

## Price discrimination/market segmentation {#pd}


### The basics

```{block2,  type='note'}

Note: This is largely undergraduate material -- I plan to update and supplement this soon with more formal material from O-R and elsewhere, and with some applied material from data science and business

```

Price Discrimination

:      The practice of firms offering different prices to different consumers

- Or different prices for slightly different *products* or quantities,
    - where the difference in price does *not* merely reflect cost difference,
    - with the goal of distinguishing consumers' *willingness to pay* (WTP).


*Note: This includes 'volume discounts', or offering an 'all you can eat' plan alongside a per-unit plan*

\

```{r  fig.cap = '', out.width='40%', fig.asp=.4, fig.align='center',  echo = FALSE}
 knitr::include_graphics(file.path("picsfigs","exeter_picturehouse.png"))
```

Why such a complicated price list?

\

#### Why do firms price discriminate? {-}

**It can increase profit...**  by 'extracting more surplus' from consumers


In general, for a monopoly firm, the ability to identify consumers based on their WTP and charge distinct prices *will* increase profit.

However, it may increase or decrease *social* (consumer+producer) surplus. Consumer surplus itself may increase or decrease.

\

#### Uniform pricing (what we were previously considering... the usual analysis) {-}

Offering a single price for a good for all consumers is known as 'uniform pricing'.

\

This does not deal with differences amongst consumers. It may ''force the firm to target a particular group'', such as the wealthy, reducing its total sales.

Under monopoly, uniform pricing leads to a deadweight loss, as we have already seen:



```{r  fig.cap = 'Source: McAfee et al. ', out.width='50%', fig.asp=.5, fig.align='center',  echo = FALSE}
 knitr::include_graphics(file.path("picsfigs","dwl_monop_mcafee.png"))
```
\

However, price discrimination holds the potential to increase profit (it will, in general, increase profit). It might also reduce the deadweight loss, i.e., increase total welfare. If price discrimination is 'Perfect' then it *will* boost total welfare, as suggested in the illustration below (see Saylor academy [First-Degree Price Discrimination: Personalized Pricing](https://saylordotorg.github.io/text_developing-new-products-and-services/s05-02-first-degree-price-discriminat.html) for an interesting discussion, but see margin note.\*)

<div class="marginnote">
**Note**: I would say that an auction *might* lead to outcomes resembling perfect price discrimination, where the seller captures most of the consumers' valuations. But this is a whole field of study, 'Auction theory', which engages the issues of Asymmetric information and Mechanism design (principle/agent models).
</div>



```{r  fig.cap = 'Source: Saylor Academy', out.width='80%', fig.asp=.8, fig.align='center',  echo = FALSE}
 knitr::include_graphics(file.path("picsfigs","saylor_single_price.png"))

 knitr::include_graphics(file.path("picsfigs","saylor_ppd_auction.png"))
```


\

**But if it is not 'perfect', price discrimination can reduce (or increase) welfare...**

\

```{block2,  type='inputq'}

Price discrimination may seem counter-intuitive: ‘how can offering some consumers lower prices increase profit?’

```


```{block2,  type='fold'}

- Higher prices increase your profit per unit, but at a higher price you will sell fewer units. The more you charge the less you sell.

- Some groups of ‘less keen’ consumers are very sensitive to the price, and they will buy very little at a high price, so a lower price would be more profitable.

- Some groups of ‘more keen’ consumers will buy a lot even at a high price. They are less ‘price-sensitive’, so you want to charge them more.

```


\

### The three types of price discrimination {-}

1. Individual-based (First degree; at best 'perfect')



Note that 'targeting a price at each consumer' may be done on the internet or on a discretionary basis by an individual seller.  But this alone does not imply Perfect price discrimination.

'Perfect' means the seller exactly predicts and charges each consumer her exact valuation! It's basically a theoretical ideal.


<br>


2. Self-selection (Second degree)



For 'self-selection' or 'second-degree price discrimination... we can imagine that  the firm doesn't know each consumer's valuations.  Or, perhaps the firm is not allowed to 'discriminate' by charging different prices to different people.

\

Instead, it sells different bundles, quantities or qualities of products to get high and low-value consumers to separate themselves...
 E.g., first-class seats.

<br>


```{block2,  type='note'}

 To fully analyse these problems we need to know the techniques of 'mechanism design under asymmetric information'; we will touch on this later in the module, time permitting, and cover a brief version of it here, following the O-R notes.

There are some interesting results, such as 'the firm finds it optimal to make the low(er)-valuing type/types' bundle smaller or lower-quality than would be efficient (called quality or quantity distortion), while the higher-valuing type gets a 'rent' (consumer surplus).

```


 \


3. Group-based (Third degree; 'market separation')


Here the firm finds something identifiable and inherent about the consumer  that is indicative of her likely valuations (and price-sensitivity). \
It might be her age, nationality, student-status, or even perhaps her income.


\

## First-degree and/or 'perfect' price discrimination


<center>

Is this perfect price discrimination or something else?

<iframe width="800" height="500" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/tXpx21Uf7hs" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

</center>


- The firm can offer each individual a different price for each unit they purchase.

- Assuming you know what the consumer is willing to pay, you can make the *highest possible profit*; that is called ‘perfect’ price discrimination.


<br>


Perfect price discrimination
:     Charging each consumer (for each unit) the *maximum* he or she would be willing to pay, i.e., her valuation


<br>


Here the monopolist would extract *all the available surplus*; no consumer surplus remains.

Because the monopolists extracts *all* the possible surplus, this is efficient!  This holds because the monopolist captures:

$\max$(total value of good - cost) $\rightarrow$ max(CS+PS)

\

But perfect PD is a rare/impossible extreme: requires mind reading.

A possible close example: a website targets an individualised price to each consumer, based on clues like time-of-day, web clicks, cookie data, IP location. But even this is not really *perfect* price discrimination:
Here, the seller does not really know exactly what the consumer is willing to pay; he is using broad clues.

What kind of price discrimination is this? Should it be legal?

</center>


```{block2,  type='warning'}

*Wait: did he just jump from first degree to third-degree price discrimination? Where did second-degree go?*

\

Yes I did. Third degree price discrimination, or 'market segmentation' is a much simpler concept than second-degree price discrimination, which involves self-selection. We will return to the latter [below](#implicitpd).

```


\

Third-degree price discrimination/Market-separation
:    The practice of charging different prices to different groups that can be identified

Here, the firm can differentiate *groups of consumers* or 'local markets', not individuals.

Each group has a different willingness to pay *on average*.

\

$\rightarrow$ Offer lower prices to lower-valuing groups, higher prices to higher-valuing groups.

\

**Example:** Students and old-age-pensioners may face lower prices for transport, food and other goods; as they have a lower willingness to pay for these

Remember: this is *not* done out of charity but to boost profits.

\

### Pricing under 3dpd/market separation (calculations/graphical depiction) {-}

Each group or market has it's own demand $\rightarrow$ marginal revenue curve

- So set an optimising price quantity *separately* for each group.

- E.g., a discount for the elderly, higher price for the middle-aged

- Or a lower price in Portugal than in Germany

Consider the above image (from Wikipedia),^[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Price_discrimination#/media/File:Price_discrimination_(third_degree).svg]

On the left, for the 'inelastic submarket' the profit-maximising price is larger than for the 'elastic submarket' in the middle.\*
<div class="marginnote">
\* Note that technically, with linear demand, as shown, the price elasticities vary at every point on the demand curve.
</div>

If the submarkets cannot be separated, or the customers in each submarket cannot be distinguished from one another, the firm must charge a single price for the entire 'industry' (on the right), which sums the demand curves in each submarket.\*

<div class="marginnote">
Note that the 'Industry' demand curve is kinked at the price where consumers in the elastic submarket begin to buy.
</div>

The industry 'entire market'  price "$P_m$ will, in general, be in between the optimizing price in the inelastic and elastic markets, so $P_a > P_m > P_b$ for the above example.

- $C$ depicts the cost (of production) function

- $\succsim$ represents the monopolist's preferences; we'll assume it maximizes profit.

... they assume cost and all segmented demand functions are differentiable.

\


> For each segment $i$ let $MR_i$ be the marginal revenue function for $q_i$, and let MC be the marginal cost function for $C$.

As they note previously, "this problem cannot be decomposed into $k$ independent problems because the cost is a function of the total output".\*

<div class="marginnote">

\* However, if we assume a constant marginal cost, as is often assumed in simplified models, then these problems *can* be decomposed, and the monopoly will simply set MR=MC in each segment, without needing to consider the other segment.
</div>

Because of this, a change in the demand conditions in one segment may impact the optimal price in another segment, through the impact on marginal cost.

```{block2,  type='note'}

E.g., suppose the sole delivery food provider in Exeter is 'Kangalivery', which has a separate delivery price for students and non-students. Suppose Kangalivery's marginal cost of delivering food in Exeter is everywhere increasing.  Then if an influx of tourists causes non-student demand to shift outwards, the delivery price for *students* (as well as nonstudents) is likely to rise, and the quantity provided to students is likely to fall.

```


\

> If the monopolist’s preferences are profit-maximizing and his optimal output $y_i{\ast}$ in segment $i$ is positive, then 


$$MR_i(y_i^{\ast}) = MC(\sum_{j=1}^k y_j^{\ast}).$$

\

O-R offer good intuition for this:

> First, the marginal revenues for all segments in which output is positive must be the same since otherwise the producer could increase his profit by moving some production from a segment with a low marginal revenue to one with a high marginal revenue.

> Second, if the marginal cost is higher than the common marginal revenue then the producer can [reduce] increase his profit by reducing production, and if the marginal cost is smaller than the common marginal revenue he can increase his profit by increasing production.

\

## Who benefits from 3DPD?

- Consumers *in the identifiable segment* with lower wtp face lower prices, thus they benefit

- Consumers *in the identifiable segment* with higher wtp face higher prices, thus they lose

- Firms can charge higher prices to high-wtp segment without losing low-wtp segment $\rightarrow$ increase profit.


 \


*Net welfare result:* theoretically ambiguous, i.e., 'it depends' on several things.  This is a nuanced point, but I think you are up to the challenge! This is *not* covered in most of the textbooks, but I give several explanations below [and see references above](#pd_lit).

### Why is the benefit uncertain? {-}

**Exchange efficiency**

When groups can be identified as 'low and high valuation'

- the high-valuation groups get charged more, and thus consume less

- low-valuation groups get charged less, and consume more

$\rightarrow$ Exchange efficiency: *given what is produced*, PD causes it to be consumed by people who value it relatively less!

\

**Top-level efficiency; amount produced**

On the other hand, PD could lead more to be produced/consumed (but not necessarily) of the otherwise underproduced 'monopolised' good (remember the general DWL of monopoly).

$\rightarrow$ top-level (allocative) efficiency may increase (or decrease).

\

E.g., suppose that with a 'uniform price' only the wealthy went to a restaurant...

- after PD (early-bird discounts, OAP discounts, benefits discounts) the low-income may also dine in the restaurant

- $\rightarrow$ more value is produced

\

Considering the two effects on efficiency just described ... one (Exchange efficiency) is negative and the other (Top-level) may be positive or negative. If the latter is positive (if production increases with PD) the effects trade off one another. Because the 'Exchange efficiency effect' is negative, the quantity produced *must* increase after PD for it to be beneficial. But this quantity increase is a necessary but not a sufficient condition; this effect also must be large enough to *outweigh* the exchange-efficiency effect.

\


## Arbitrage ...  can foil price discrimination {#arbitrage}

<div class="marginnote">
The word 'foil' basically means 'defeat'.
</div>



If, e.g., elderly who get discounts could sell the products to the middle-aged...

- Then middle-aged would always ask them to do this, never pay high prices

- Firm could no longer profit from this

- Similar issues with quantity discounts, or 'web cookie' personalised pricing

\

So PD only 'works' for goods that are hard to trade, like haircuts...

or where purchases are frequent and low-value, and resale markets are difficult

(The above issues are sometimes referred to as 'transactions costs'.)

```{block2,  type='warning'}

When I ask about the welfare effect of price discrimination, students often mention arbitrage in this discussion. However, the potential for arbitrage doesn't make price discrimination *inefficient*, it just makes it *ineffectual* and makes firms not want to bother doing it.

```

This yields another mechanism design 'hidden information' 'principal-agent problem'

## 'Second-degree price discrimination', i.e., 'self-selection', i.e., 'implicit discrimination' {#implicitpd}



```{block2,  type='note'}

This section also serves as an 'applied' introduction to asymmetric information and principal-agent models (which I cover in more detail in the [supplement](#asymmetric))

Self-selection and price discrimination is addressed in O-R section 7.4, which I go through [below](#or-self-sel). 
  
However, you might find my ['semi-parametric' depiction](#self-par) (following Laffont and Martimort) to be a bit simpler.

```


Here the firm is unable to differentiate between consumers *explicitly*.  Instead it offers various varieties and bundles. It uses variations in quality or quantity to get consumers to "self-select."

\

Some examples:

- Quality: Transport- Different classes, Supermarkets- budget products

- Quantity: Supermarkets- Larger quantities at lower prices per unit; i.e., 'nonlinear pricing'


\ 

Consider...

**Quantity**

An 8 ounce cup of coffee for £1.60 vs. 16 ounces for £2.00

- 20 p per oz vs. 12.5p per oz.  (with linear pricing there would be the same price of 15p/oz.)

\

$\rightarrow$  Result: with 2 prices monopoly can get 'high value' consumers to buy/get more in total without losing 'low-value' consumers


\



**Quality**

The calculations are similar when we consider variations in quality:

An airline doesn't know whom the high-valuation flyers are (willingness-to-pay, 'wtp' for travel *itself* varies)

But it may know on *average* that flyers with higher wtp for travel *also* value comfort more. Thus:

- Make second-class seats very uncomfortable, first-class luxurious, and charge more for first-class seats

- Can get consumers with higher values for travel *and* comfort to pay more

- ...without losing lower-valuing customers



\

### The 'self-selection' problem {-}

Train companies must price first and second class such that consumers will self-select.

- If first class is too expensive then the high valuing group will not choose first class

- If second-class is too cheap, both the high and low groups will choose second class

- But if second class is too expensive, the low groups will not buy a ticket.

### Formal characterisation (O-R) {#implicitpd_formal} 

The self-selection problem is characterized by a 'menu' of items that the firm offers, each item having a price and a quantity (or level of quality). To achieve the desired "self selection", as implied above, several 'constraints' must be met. These constraints are necessary so that each of the consumers prefers to choose the item 'intended for them' (rather than another menu item), and also wants to buy something rather than nothing. 

Following O-R, we present a somewhat general definition, and then prove and discuss results for a two-consumer case. (Time-permitting: parametric examples.)

```{block2,  type='note'}

This is an example of an asymmetric information problem: the consumer has more information about her own value then does the monopolist. This setup is also mathematically equivalent to a general class of "principal agent" and "hidden information" problems. If you further study 'agency theory', 'contract theory', or 'mechanism design', you will see this setup again. This is a workhorse setup in modern microeconomics. For a standard treatment of the 'hidden information' problem, see my slides [HERE](https://www.dropbox.com/s/mdit2mvjnln2bt2/beem101_adapt_hidden_info_slides_ho.pdf?dl=0), with content drawn from Laffont and Martimort, 2002, and Salanie, 2005.  

```  


\

First a fairly general definition of 'a monopolistic market with a menu' from O-R, allowing for any number of consumers with distinct valuations of each of the different quantities of the good:

> *Demand* 
  
> The function $V_i$ is the value function for consumer $i$, giving the maximum amount $V_i (q)$ consumer $i$ is willing to pay for $q$ units of the good.  
  

\
This is similar to value functions we've seen before.\*

<div class="marginnote">
\*Consider the 'contribution to utility'  made by the consumption of a single good, holding other consumption constant, as expressed in the 'units of other goods one would be willing to give up'.  
</div>

\

Defining these value functions 


> A collection $(V^i)^n_{i=1}$ of increasing continuous [value] functions, where $V_i : [0,1] \rightarrow  R^+$ and $V_i(0) = 0.$ 

To consider this most simply, they 'normalise' the units of 'quantity of the good' (or 'quality of the good') to fall between 0 and 1, including the endpoints (that's what the closed set $[0,1]$ denotes).

They normalise the value of consuming 0 units to 0, for all types of consumer. 

Note that, as these are increasing functions, each consumer's value is increasing in the amount consumed, up to a maximum value at 1 unit consumed.

<div class="marginnote">

I keep mentioning that this can also express units of *quality* (rather than quantity). The problem is mathematically equivalent if, as is commonly seen in the real world, a firm uses product quality to get consumers to self-select.

</div>
 

\

> *Producer*

> A single producer, called a *monopolist*, with no costs, who chooses a set $M$ of pairs, called a *menu*, where a pair $(q,m)$ represents the option to buy q units of the good at the (total) price $m$.

\

Each consumer chooses whether to buy one item on this menu, or nothing at all:

> If $V_i(q)−m ≥ 0$ for some $(q,m) \in M$, consumer $i$ chooses an option $(q,m) \in M$ for which $V_i(q)−m$ is maximal; otherwise she buys nothing. 

\

> The producer chooses M [the set of menu items] so that the consumers’ choices maximize her profit.

Problems like this are often stated in terms of the firm (or "principal") choosing the values of the menu elements to maximize their payoffs subject to certain constraints. The problem is broken up into two parts --

1. We consider each of the different 'implementations', i.e., the ways a firm might want get consumers to self-select into choosing different menu items. 

For example...

```{block2,  type='fold'}

Considering a set of consumers with 'high', 'medium', and 'low' valuations of each unit of the product, where there is no overlap in valuations: 
  
- 'Fully separating'... each of the three types of consumers may select a different menu item, perhaps the highest value select the highest cost and largest menu item, the medium select the medium item, and the lowest value consumer select the cheapest and smallest item.

- 'Fully pooling'... all of the consumers select the same item

- 'Partial pooling'... The high and medium value consumer select the same item, while the low value consumers select a smaller and cheaper item

- 'Partial shut-down' or the the high and medium value consumers may select different items, while the low value consumers do not purchase anything at all, they are 'shut down'.


```


<div class="marginnote">
For a general class of cases it can be shown that the fully pooling outcome is not profit-maximizing.
</div>
 

\

2. Given the chosen 'implementation', we consider the maximum profit the firm can make with this implementation. It cannot simply choose any price and any quantity for each menu item. To achieve a particular set of consumer choices (to pool, separate, etc), it will need to consider two constraints on the menu:


- *'Incentive Compatibility (IC) constraint':* Among the items on the menu, each consumer must gets the greatest payoff from making the choice that the firm wants  it to make (rather than by choosing another menu item).

- *'Participation constraint' (PC)*: Each consumer must prefer to choose the menu item the firm wants it to choose over "not participating at all", i.e., over not buying anything.

<div class="marginnote">
The participation constraint is sometimes referred to as the individual rationality (IR) constraint. 
</div>
 
\

To find the most profitable strategy, we need to consider all of the possible implementations, determine the profits from each, and find the implementation that yields the greatest profits.


\

```{block2,  type='note'}

The O-R example below is somewhat unusual. I intend to add a more standard parametric example here, with an algebraic as well as a graphical depiction, both in text and in a video.

```  


[Exeter video: Self-selection (2nd degree PD); informal graphical presentation](https://web.microsoftstream.com/video/52515070-19b0-4cd5-ae64-75f61a436be3)


### Two consumer 'Monopolistic market with a menu' (O-R Prop 7.3) 

> Consider a two-consumer *monopolistic market with a menu* .... in which  $V^1(q^1)−V^1(q^2) > V^2 (q^1) − V^2 (q^2)$ whenever $q^1 > q^2 \geq 0$

Here we define defining a meaningful setup in which consumer 1 is the 'high type consumer' and  consumer 2 is the 'low type'; the latter has an unambiguously lower valuation of each additional unit. The above simply states that consumer 1 gets more 'additional value from having a larger  ($q^1$) rather than a smaller amount ($q^2$)' than does consumer 2, no matter which pairs ofamounts we are considering. I.e., starting from any point, consumer 1 always values additional units more than does consumer 2. 

\

For future use, let us define 'the difference in the value of $q$ units to consumer 1 relative to consumer 2' as:

$$\Delta\big(V(q)\big) \equiv V^1(q) - V^2(q).$$

\

> Let $q^{\ast}$ be a maximizer of $2V^2(q) − V^1(q)$.

It's not yet so intuitive why this is an important term, but we can flesh out some interpretation of what it means:

```{block2,  type='fold'}

$2V^2(q)$ is "twice the low type's" value of $q$ units. Note that this is the revenue at the highest price that would still induce *both* consumers to buy $q$ units.

$V^1(q)$ is "the high type's value of $q$ units". 

Thus  $2V^2(q) − V^1(q)$ is thus "the difference in revenue from selling a particular $q$ to both consumers versus only selling it to one (high type) consumer". 

Thus $q^{\ast}$, the maximizer of this, is "the quantity at which the benefit from selling to both consumers is highest, relative to selling to one consumer." 


But actually, this seems 'coincidental'; the story below is different (I wonder how to bring these intuitions together?).

```

\


> The monopolist’s maximal profit is $max\{V^1(1), 2V^2(1), V^1(1) + 2V^2(q^{\ast}) − V^1(q^{\ast})\}$.



This represents the maximum of three possible implementations (noting revenue is the same as profit here, as costs are assumed to be zero). We consider each of these terms...

1. **'Shut down'**: $V^1(1)$ revenue results from the selling one unit to the high-type and 'shutting down' the low type. Formally, this menu is  $\{(1,V^1(1))\}$, specifying the amount and the price, respectively.  Among the *'shut down'* implementations, this is the most profitable. Here's why:

```{block2,  type='fold'}

If we only are selling to the high type, consumer 1, we only need to meet her 'participation constraint'; we can offer her a single menu item with any price and any quantity (or quality). She will coose this (rather than purchasing nothing), if its value to her meets or exceeds its price. Her value is highest at $q=1$ unit: she values this at $V^1(1)$. So we offer her a menu with only this 'maximal 1 unit' quantity and we charge her  $V^1(1)$ for it. It is part of an equilibrium strategy for this customer to buy this 1 unit rather than to not buy this one unit.\*

Of course, the lower type, consumer 2, values 1 unit at $V^2(1) < V^1(1)$, so he will not pay this price and he is 'shut down'. 

```

<div class="marginnote">
\* By convention, we assume, for such problems, that when an 'agent' (here the consumer) is indifferent, she will make the choice that the 'principal' (the one proposing the 'contract' or menu, here this is the monopoly producer) wants her to make. There are several justifications for this: 

1.  Although the agent is indifferent between accepting and rejecting, accepting *is* a best response, and it is the only one that is part of an equilibrium 

2. The outcome and payoffs are nearly identical to a case where the principal offers a 'tiny bit more' in the menu item, to give the agent a strict preference for accepting this.

</div>
 

\

2. **'Pooling'**: $2V^2(1)$ revenue results from offering a single menu item with 1 unit, charging a price that both the high and low type will be willing to pay. Formally, this menu is $\{(1,V^2(1))\}$. 

Among the *'pooling'* implementations, this is the most profitable.\* 

<div class="marginnote">
\* However, note that for a general class of cases, the pooling implementation will *not* be revenue-maximising.
</div>
 
Here's why: 

```{block2,  type='fold'}

If we are offering a single menu item and we want both types to buy it, we must charge a price at or below the *lower* of the two consumers' valuations. Of course there is no reason to price *below* this point, so we charge $V^2(q)$ for the quantity ($q$) that we choose, and we get revenue $2V^2(q)$, as both consumers buy it.

Given we are getting $2V^2(q)$ in revenue, and costs are 0, we will choose the quantity (or quality) $q$ that maximizes the value for the low type; here this is (again) $q=1$. 

```

\

3. **'Separating'**: $V^1(1) + 2V^2(q^{\ast}) − V^1(q^{\ast})$ is the maximum revenue that could result from an implementation where we get the low- and high-type consumers to buy distinct quantities (or qualities), and pay different amounts.

Note that this is equivalent to $V^1(1) + V^2(q^{\ast}) - \Delta\big(V(q^{\ast})\big)$.

\

This results from offering a menu with two items and two prices, $M\ast= \{(q^{\ast},V^2(q^{\ast}), (1,V_1(1) − \Delta\big(V(q^{\ast})\big))\}$. (Note I am switching the order presented in O-R here).

\

I.e.:

The **second item** contains the quantity $q^{\ast}$ defined above (and in general, $q^{\ast}<1$), priced at $V^2(q^{\ast})$, the low-type's valuation of this quantity. This item will be chosen by the low-type (consumer 2).

In fact, this exactly meets the "low type's participation constraint": the price is just low enough to get him to buy this item, rather than buy nothing.


The **first item** contains the maximal quantity (1 unit). It's price is $V_1(1) −\Delta \big(V(q^{\ast})\big)$. This item will be chosen by the high-type (consumer 1).
 
- Note that this price is *below* $V_1(1)$, so the high-type is paying *less* for this item than her value. 

- How much less? The second term, $\Delta \big(V(q^{\ast})\big) = (V^1(q^{\ast}) − V^2(q^{\ast}))$ represents 'the amount that the high-type consumer values the quantity in the second item ($q^\ast$) *more than the low-types valuation of this quantity.*  

  - Note that if the low-type were charged her full valuation for $q^\ast$ (which she will be), this difference tells us the amount of surplus the high-type would get from 'pretending to be the low type'. 
  
  - Thus, to get the high type not to 'pretend to be the low type', she needs to get at least this amount of surplus. This is often called an *information rent*.\*
  - Thus the price of the first item is reduced by this difference $\Delta \big(V(q^{\ast}) \big)$, so that the high type will get the same surplus from choosing her intended item.

<div class="marginnote">
\* We call it an information rent because it is the amount that one type must be compensated to "reveal her information" (through her choice). Here, the high tape has information about her value of the good that the monopoly would love to obtain. However, if she keeps it a secret, she can attain a certain surplus by pretending to be the low value type. 

In fact, the amount $\Delta\big(V(q^{\ast})\big)$ is also 'the amount the monopolist would have to pay the high value type to reveal her type' given the quantity offered to the low type ... After which point the monopolist could then choose her charge her her *full*  willingness to pay for the quantity she will consume (here, one unit).
</div>


The above formula comes from solving the high-types' 'IC constraint', getting her to choose the first item, the one intended for her, rather than choosing the second item, the one intended for the low-type. 

\

OK, this tells us what the relative prices must be to exactly satisfy the PC for the low-type and the IC for the high-type, given the quantities in each item ... but then how do we know that...:

1. (a) the PC for the low type and (b) the IC for the high type  are 'binding' and met with equality?....

(and how do we know ...we don't need to worry about the IC for the low type nor the PC for the high type?)

And how do we know that: 

2. ...the profit-maximizing quantities of each item are $1$ for the first item (for the high type) and $q^\ast$ as defined above for the second item (for the low type)?

\

(1a). Here's why we know the PC for the low type is 'binding' and met with equality:


```{block2,  type='fold'}

*Proof by contradiction...*
  
The PC for the low type must be met with equality because if it didn't, i.e., if the low type gained a positive surplus from choosing item 2, then: 

- The monopoly could raise the price of this item somewhat and increase its profit
- This would not affect any of the other constraints negatively; it would only make item 2 *less* attractive for the high type.

```

\

The above demonstrates O-R's  "**Step 1** $V^2(q^2) = m^2$." In other words, the low type is charged an amount, $m^2$, equal to his valuation of this output. His participation constraint is met with equality, he gets no rent. 

\

(1b). Here's why we know the IC for the high type is 'binding' and met with equality:

```{block2,  type='fold'}
  
*Proof by contradiction...*
  
IC for the high type must be met with equality because if it wasn't, i.e., if the high type was *strictly* better off from choosing item 1 than item 2, then: 

- The monopoly could raise the price of the item 1 somewhat, and increase its profit
- This would reduce the high type's surplus, making it's PC 'tighter'; however, as we noted above (and re-iterate below), the high type is already getting an information rent; her surplus is already positive, so reducing it a little bit will not take it below zero. Thus we don't have to worry about this causing the high type to drop out of the market completely.

- None of the other constraints would be negatively affected

```

\

Using O-R's notation, this implies:

$V^1(q^1)−m^1 = V^1(q^2)−m^2$, i.e., the high type's surplus from choosing item 1 must equal his surplus from choosing item 2. 

Plugging in $m^2=V^2(q^2)$ (low type is charged his value for item 2) yields
$V^1(q^1)−m^1 = V^1(q^2)−V^2(q^2)$; so the high type's surplus will be the difference in the valuations of the high and low type for item 2. 

Rearranging, the price for item 1 will be $m^1 = V^1(q^1)- \Delta\big(V(q^2)\big)$.

\

Here's why (2) we know that the profit-maximimizing quantities of each item are $1$ for the first item (for the high type) and $q^\ast$ as defined above for the first item (for the low type).

We've determined that the items will cost

$m^1 = V^1(q^1)- \Delta\big(V(q^2)\big) = V^1(q^1)- \big(V^1(q^2) - V^2(q^2)\big)$

and 

$m^2 = V(q^2)$.

As there are no production costs, the profit is simply:

$$\pi(q^1, q^2) = m^1(q^1, q^2) + m^2(q^2) = V^1(q^1)- \Delta\big(V(q^2)\big) = V^1(q^1)- \big(V^1(q^2) - V^2(q^2)\big) + V^2(q^2)$$\*

<div class="marginnote">
Note, in a typical depiction of this problem, we often consider 'relative shares' of consumers of each type, rather than simply two consumers.</div>
 
$q^1$, the quantity intended for the high type, only affects the amount that can be charged to the high type. Simply put, as we increase the high type's value, $V^1(q^1)$ by increasing $q^1$, we increase the price that we can charge her by this same amount. As costs are zero, we thus want to make this as large as possible, setting $q^1=1$.\*

<div class="marginnote">
\*In a more elaborate problem, with a positive marginal cost this will be set equal to the point where the marginal value equals the marginal cost, i.e., the 'efficient quantity'. 
</div>
 
\

However, notice that the quantity intended for the low type affects both:

- the value the low type gets from this $V^2(q^2)$, and thus the amount you can charge him, and

- the *information rent* that the high type must gain, $Delta\big(V(q^2)\big)$, and thus the amount you must 'reduce her price' below her valuation. 

Because of this second effect the monopolist may set the quantity intended for the low type *below* 1. This would be socially inefficient;\* if this is the case then the monopolist negatively 'distorts' the quantity (or quality) intended for the low type in order to reduce the rent it must pay to the high type.

<div class="marginnote">
\* Here, producing the maximal amount, 1 unit, for both types is the only socially efficient outcome, as the good is produced at 0 cost, and both types prefer more to less. 
</div>
 
The profit maximizing choice of $q^2$ will thus maximize (rearranging $\pi(q^1, q^2)$ above):

$V^1(q^1)- \Delta\big(V(q^2)\big) = V^1(q^1) - V^1(q^2) + 2V^2(q^2)$
.... as $q^2$ only enters into the latter terms, this is the same as 

$q^{\ast} \equiv argmax_q \big(2V^2(q) − V^1(q)\big)$, as promised.

\

We see again that  $q^2$ may be distorted downwards (and thus $q^{\ast}<1$ is possible). Notice that  term above does not simply set $q^2$ to maximise the value that the low type gets from it; restating it, we see it maximises 

$\big(V^2(q) −  \Delta\big(V(q)\big)$... 

the latter term increases in $q$, we see this will trading off the 'benefit' to the low type against the extent to which the information rent to the high type must be increased. 

\


By the way, here's why (1) we can ignore the PC for the high type and ignore the IC for the low type. 

```{block2,  type='fold'}

The PC for the high type holds automatically as a result of both the PC for the low type and the IC for the high type holding.

If we get the low type to purchase a positive amount at some price, satisfying his participation constraint (PC), it is necessarily the case that the high type would get more value from this item than does the low type. But, as noted above, we also want the high type to find it at least as attractive to choose the item intended for her, thus we make this item have at least as high a payoff for her. So the payoff for the high type from choosing the second item must be at least as high as the pay off to her from choosing the first item, and we know the latter is  strictly positive. Thus her participation constraint is automatically satisfied as a result of these other constraints.

The IC for the low type can also be ignored. It holds as a result of the other 'binding constraints' and from our assumption that the high type always gains a greater value from any increase in quantity than the low type would gain from the same increase in quantity. This can be shown algebraically, but the intuition is not quite as straightforward. Essentially, the high type will be given just enough information rent to make it attractive for her to choose the second item (we saw her IC binds). However, this differential is not enough to make this larger quantity item attractive to the low type, because of the low type's lesser valuation of additional quantity.

### Two consumer self-selection: a simpler parametric example {#self-par}

<div class="marginnote">
This draws from Laffont and Martimort (2002), section 2.1.5.2, which in turn draws from Maskin and Riley (1984)
</div>
 
**The firm** 

Suppose the firm produces at a marginal cost $c$ per unit, and no fixed costs, thus its profit when it charges $t$ for quantity $q$ is

$$V(t,q) = t - cq$$.

\

**Consumers**  

(From Laffont and Martimort, notation adjusted:)

>  The tastes of a buyer for the private good are such that his utility function is $U = \theta u(q) − t$, where $q$ is the quantity consumed and $t$ his payment to the principal. Suppose that the parameter $\theta$ of each buyer is drawn independently from the same distribution on $\theta = \theta_l, \theta_h$  with respective probabilities $1-v$ and $v$.

For 'our example', suppose $u(q) = q^{1/2}$, $\theta = \{1,2\}$ and $v = 1/4$. Here we would  have a $1/4$ probability of a 'high-type' consumer who gets value $2q^{1/2}$ from $q$ units, and the remaining $3/4$ probability of a 'low-type' consumer who gets value $q^{1/2}$ from $q$ units.

Let's also define $\Delta\theta = \theta_h- \theta_l$, the proportional difference in value of each unit for the high versus low type. For 'our example', $\Delta\theta = 1$, implying that the high type always gets twice as much value from a particular quantity (or quality) as the low type.  

\

Suppose that the firm offers two menu items:

<div class="marginnote">
In fact, as discussed elswehere, it is never optimal for the firm to offer *more* menu items than types of consumers, at least as long as the consumers are optimizing in a standard sense.
</div>
 

-  $q_l$ units of quality (or quantity) for price $t_l$,
-  $q_h$ units of quality (or quantity) for price $t_h$,

...and suppose the low-type consumer chooses the first menu item and the high-type consumer the second item.
\


We can now define the 'rents' (i.e., value of the good less the price paid) of the low ($l$) and high ($h$) type  consumer as:

- $U_l = \theta_l u(q_l) − t_l$ and 
- $U_h = \theta_h u(q_h) − t_h$,

respectively.

\

To induce these menu choices, both consumers must want to purchase their intended menu item. Each consumer most prefer this

- over 'not buying anything' ... the 'participation constraint' (PC) and
- over 'buying the other menu item' ... the 'incentive compatibility constraint (IC).

(Let the 'rent' from not buying anything equal to 0.)

Specifically, we need:

$$\begin{aligned}
U_l \geq 0 \:\:\:\:\:\:\:\: [PC_l]\\
U_h \geq 0 \:\:\:\:\:\:\:\: [PC_h]\\
U_l \geq U_h - \Delta \theta u(q_h)  \:\:\:\:\:\:\:\: [IC_l]\\
U_h \geq U_l + \Delta \theta u(q_l)  \:\:\:\:\:\:\:\: [IC_h]\\
\end{aligned}$$
\

Explaining the above:

```{block2,  type='fold'}

$PC_l$ and $PC_h$: Recall our previous definition of the 'rents' (essentially willingness-to-pay in excess of price, i.e., 'payoff') for each type, $U_l$ and $U_h$.  These must each be non-negative; each consumer must get at least as much value from their menu item as the price they pay for it. 

\


$IC_l$: The low-type's payoff from chis own choice, $U_l$, must exceed the payoff he would get from choosing the other menu item: $\theta_l u(q_h) - t_h$. His payoff from this latter menu item equals the payoff the high type gets from this menu item *minus their differential value of this item $\Delta \theta u(q_h)$, as he always values any quantity less than the chigh-type ... thus $U_l \geq U_h - \Delta \theta u(q_h)$ must hold.

\


$IC_h$: The high-type's payoff from her own choice, $U_h$, must exceed the payoff she would get from choosing the other menu item: $\theta_l u(q_l) - t_h$. Her payoff from this latter menu item equals the payoff the clow type gets from this menu item *plus* her differential value of this item $\Delta \theta u(q_h)$, as she always values any quantity more than the low-type ... thus $U_h \geq U_l + \Delta \theta u(q_l)$   must hold.

```

\


As discussed in the previous section (and in more detail in the [Supplement on Hidden Information](#hidden-info)), only $PC_l$ and $IC_h$ are binding (assuming we want to sell a positive amount to each type.) This implies they must hold with *equality*.

Thus $U_l = 0$ and $U_h = U_l + \Delta \theta u(q_l)$.


This tells us the 'rent' of the low type wil be 0, and the rent of the high type will be the difference in valuation of $q_l$ between the types, which is positive if $q_l$ is set to be positive. 
\

Unpacking these, we have 

$\theta_l u(q_l) − t_l$ implying $t_l=\theta_l u(q_l)$

and we have 

$\theta_h u(q_h) = \theta_l u(q_l) − t_l + \Delta \theta u(q_l)$;

plugging in the $t_l$ just derived (or noting $U_l = 0$)...

$\theta_h u(q_h) - t_h = \theta_l u(q_l) − \theta_l u(q_l + \Delta \theta u(q_l) = \Delta \theta u(q_l)$.

implying $t_h = \theta_h u(q_h) - \Delta \theta u(q_l)$,

i.e. (unpacking the $\Delta \theta$) $t_h = \theta_h u(q_h) - (\theta_h - \theta_l) u(q_l)$.

\

Note that as the quantity for the low type $q_l$ is increased, $u(q_l)$ increases (assume it's an increasing function), and thus $(\theta_h - \theta_l)u(q_l)$, the 'rent' that must be left to the high type, to keep her from pretending to be the low type, must also increase. Thus $q_l$ will not simply be set to trade off the value of the person who buys it against the marginal cost of production, but also in light of the incentive to avoid paying a rent ... thus 'distorted downwards' in a wide set of cases. 

\

Now we can consider the firm's optimization problem: 

$$\pi(t_l, t_h, q_l, q_h) = max_{t_l,t_h,q_l,q_h} (1-v) \times (t_l - cq_l) + v \times (t_h-cq_h) $$
Subject to all of the constraints above.

Substituting in $t_l$ and $t_h$ implied by the binding constraints yields:


$$\pi(q_l, q_h) = max_{q_l,q_h} (1-v)(\theta_l u({q_l}) - cq_l) + v( \theta_h u(q_h) - (\theta_h - \theta_l) u(q_l)-cq_h)$$
If this is a standard 'concave problem' (which will be implied by a concave value function $u$) we simply need to take the first-order-conditions wrt the choice variables $q_l$ and $q_h$.

Note  $q_h$ only enters into the part of the profit that comes from 'when we actually are selling to a high type.' Thus we simply find the (efficient) quantity where her marginal value equals the marginal cost:

$v \theta_h u'(q_h) = vc \rightarrow \theta_h u'(q_h) = c$ ... noting that $\theta_h u'(q_h)$ represents the high-types marginal value at $q_h$ units.

\

However $q_l$ enters into the profit when we *actually* sell to a low type *as well as* when we sell to a high type. Taking the FOC (and re-using the 'difference in value' $\Delta$ notation:

$(1-v)\times \big(\theta_l u'(q_l) - c\big) - v\times(\Delta \theta u'(q_l)\big)=0$

Note that if only the  *first* term were present, e.g., if $v=0$ and we could price exclusively to the low type without worrying about the high type, we would choose the socially-efficient level of $q_l$, trading off the marginal cost $c$ against his marginal benefit, i.e., where $\theta_l u'(q_l)=c$. 

However, the second term causes the 'downward quality' (or quantity) distortion of $q_l$ below this level.  Rearranging this yields:

$(\theta_l-\frac{v}{1-v}\Delta\theta) u'(q_l)=c$, implying $q_l$ must be less than the 'first best' $q_l$.
\

Note that the greater the probability ($v$) of a high type, the greater the distortion of the low-type's quantity.

<div class="marginnote">
It may be that even the *first* unit of $q_l$ has too much of an effect on the information rent that must be paid to the high type to be worth offering. Here the above would solve to a 'negative optimal $q_l$, but the true optimal $q_l=0$, the 'shut down' policy. 
</div>
 

\

*Returning to 'our example'*, where  $u(q) = q^{1/2}$, $\theta = \{1,2\}$ and $v = 1/4$, implying $\Delta\theta=1$, and letting $c=1$:

$(1-\frac{1}{3}) \frac{1}{2} q_l^{-1/2} =\frac{1}{3} q_l^{-1/2}  =1$

$\rightarrow q_l = 3^{-2} = 1/9$


\

In contrast, if we could sell to the low-type in isolation (we knew his type ... sort of 'perfect price discrimination') we would choose the efficient quantity according to:

$\theta_l u'(q_{l,FB}) = c$, for our example implying the 'First Best'

$\frac{1}{2} q_{l,FB}^{-1/2} =1$

$\rightarrow q_{l,FB} = 1^{-2} = 1$.

Quite a distortion in this example!

## Welfare loss of monopoly: Discussion question from a prior exam

- Depict and discuss the welfare costs of monopoly power as a 'market failure'. What are some factors that may lead estimates of these costs to be higher or lower?

**Solution help:**

```{block2,  type='fold'}

See especially the section [The deadweight loss of monopoly](#dwl-monop) and accompanying discussion in the NS text.

You should identify the DWL of monopoly as a reduction in top-level (allocative) efficiency. Please discuss this clearly and in your own words, showing your understanding.

```
\

- Will price discrimination reduce or increase the welfare cost of monopoly. Discuss.

**Solution help:**

```{block2,  type='fold'}

'Perfect' price discrimination reduces the welfare loss, but is a theoretical ideal, not a realistic real-world practice. See [here](#fdpd); illustrate this in a simple diagram.

2dpd and 3dpd may increase or reduce the welfare cost of monopoly (i.e., reduce or increase welfare relative to a single-price monopoly). There is a tradeoff between a reduction in exchange efficiency and a *possible* increase in output which would imply an increase in alloctive efficiency. See extensive discussion of [3dpd here](#pd3d) and in linked readings. State and explain this in your own words.

```

# Monopoly pricing: Examples using R {-}


## Simulating willingness to pay and considering 'optimal pricing' 

```{block2,  type='note'}
Remember, you can 'hide the code' with the 'hide global' button in the upper right of this screen.

</div>

```{block2,  type='note'}

Although this module is not about coding, you might find it insightful to consider how to use R code to calculate and graph and simulate the monopoly/pricing outcomes.

I hope this makes the theory a bit more concrete. It is obviously a great career and research skill to have some understanding of how to use computers to do simulations and to work with data.

If you can install R (and ideally RStudio), you might like to try to run the code yourself, and tweak certain parts to see how things change. R/Rstudio shoulda lso be installed on most university computers. If you just want to do a quick try, you can simply enter code into a hosted browser interface like the one below [Hosted here](https://rdrr.io/snippets/)... but Rstudio will be better in the long run.

\

> Our monopolist is a broadband internet supplier within a city. Suppose for now that they only offer one bundle. For now we will consider a scenario with 2000 potential consumers but this can be changed by altering the `npeep` variable. 


> For each of these consumers we generate a willingness to pay for broadband internet (internet). [We assume that the mean WTP is £45]... and we add an error term to this in order to simulate variation between consumers. To do this we use the `rnorm` function which draws a random sample from the standard normal distribution (mean 0, variance 1) multiplied by £15. This yields a standard deviation of roughly £15.

<div class="marginnote">
A normal distribution follows the traditional "bell shape". Perhaps it's reasonable to assume that willingness to pay is normally distributed, but other distributions might also be possible, such as a "power law" distribution, with much longer "tails" then the normal distribution. 

[Some have claimed (but there is disagreement)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378437114002544#:~:text=His%20work%20suggested%20that%20the,or%20power%2Dlaw)%20exponent) that wealth follows a "power law' distribution, suggesting wtp might do so as well.

</div>
 

```{r}

npeep <- 2000 # Number of potential consumers

wtp <- 45 + rnorm(npeep)*15 # Each person has a different willingness to pay

```

\

Checking, the standard deviation  is `r sd(wtp)` (coded as  `sd(wtp)`). The exact number will vary each time you run the simulation in R but it will generally be close to 15.

\

> To figure out the demand curve we count the number of people willing to pay at least as much as the offering price.

\

We set the maximum offered price to 90, thus we consider prices between 0 and 90. From this we sum the number of consumers who have a willingness to pay above the offering price in order to give us a vector of quantity demanded at each price level.


```{r}

maxop <- 90 # Max offering price
op <- 0:maxop # Offering price ranges from 0 to maxop i.e 0,1, ... 90

qd <- rep(NA,length(op)) # Empty vector for quantity demanded
for (i in 1:length(op)) qd[i] <- sum(wtp>=op[i]) # We fill qd with the number of consumers with a wtp >= offering price
```

\
Let's look at the 'vector of quantities demanded'

`r qd`

The code above has simply created a vector that computes the quantity demanded at each of the 90 prices £1, £2, ..., £90, given the simulated willinges to pay for the 2000 potential consumers. 

\



We assume:

> Marginal cost is increasing though this is not a necessity. For something like broadband services we might think that up to a point marginal costs might be decreasing since the cost of adding one more customer might be less than the cost of adding the previous customer.

In our simulation we assume $MC = 0.01(q_d)$

```{r}
mc <- qd*.01 # Setting marginal cost
```

\

Now we plot quantity demanded as a function of price:

```{r}

plot(qd, op, type="l", xlab="Quantity", ylab="Price,  Cost",
      main="Demand for Broadband Internet", lwd=2)
abline(h=0, lwd=2)
lines(qd, mc, col="red", lwd=2)
legend(1450, 75, legend=c("Demand curve", "Marginal Cost"), col=c("black", "red"), lty=1)

```


Above, we see that marginal cost only exceeds the "last consumer's value" (thus the price that can be charged) ... when output is around 1800 and the inverse demand (price that can be charged) and marginal cost meet at around 20.

\

> The monopolist must choose a price in which to sell services at. If the monopolist chooses $MC=P$ then the monopolist will not make any money but the consumers will be very happy. We know that the optimal point for the monopolist is at the point where marginal revenue curve intersects the marginal cost curve. Let's see if we can find it.

```{r}

tr <- tp <- tc <- rep(NA,length(op)) # Total revenue, total profit, total cost vectors

```

\

Total cost just sums the marginal cost of all units; we generate this vertor for each of the quantities sold at the prices under consideration...

```{r}
# Calculate total cost

qd.gain <- qd[-length(qd)]-qd[-1]
qd.gain[length(qd.gain)+1] <- qd.gain[length(qd.gain)]
for (i in 1:length(op)) tc[i] <- sum((mc*qd.gain)[length(qd):i])

```



\

Next we calculate total revenue and total profit ... again for each element of the vector.  


```{r}

tr <- qd*op
tp <- tr-tc
```

\
<!-- Todo @oska -- compute and plot marginal revenue here --> 

Next we plot total revenue and total profit against the considered prices.

```{r}
minmax <- function(...) c(min(...),max(...)) # I think this function is simply used to define the plot scalre

#They use the traditional "plot" function. Ggplot  tools are much much better, and we will try to switch the code when we have a chance.

plot(minmax(op),minmax(tr,tp), type="n", ylab="Cost / Profit",
     xlab="Price",
     main="We can see optimal pricing for the monopolist is around £39:")

grid()
abline(h=0, lwd=2)
abline(v=39, col="red", lwd=2)
lines(op,tr, col="blue", lwd=3)
lines(op,tp, col="red", lwd=2)
legend(65, y = 45000, legend=c("Total revenue", "Total profit"), col=c("blue", "red"), lty=1, cex=0.72)
```

The monopolist calculates total revenue and total profit for each price.

> We can see at the price around 18 which would be the optimal price for the consumer [recall that this is the result of marginal-cost pricing], the supplier is making almost no profits.

<div class="marginnote">
There are still some profits to be had here as with increasing marginal cost the average cost is less than the marginal cost. 
</div>
 

On the other hand, the monopoly's profit maximising price is around £39.

(Note that this is slightly higher than the total-revenue-maximizing price.)

\


> The last thing we might wish to consider to Total Surplus or total system efficiency which is defined as that which the consumer benefits by purchasing a good below the consumers willingness to pay plus that of the suppliers profit at that price.

<div class="marginnote">
Technically we might want to consider what is called total surplus, summing consumer and producer surplus, which does not consider fixed costs. After fixed Costs are incurred they are "sunk" and thus not relevant for the social efficiency of the pricing decision.

.</div>
 

```{r}

cs <- tr
for (i in 1:length(op)) cs[i] <- sum((wtp[wtp>=op[i]]-op[i]))

tts <- cs+tp

op[tts==max(tts)] # Check the optimal societal price

plot(c(min(op),max(op)),c(min(cs,tp),max(cs,tp)), type="n",
     main="How does surplus vary for different prices?",
     xlab="Price",
     ylab="Surplus")
lines(op, cs, col="purple", lwd=2)
lines(op, tp, col="blue", lwd=2)
lines(op, tts, lwd=2)
abline(h=0,col="red", lwd=2)
legend(60, 75000, legend=c("Consumer surplus", "Producer surplus", "Total surplus"), col=c("purple","blue","black"),lty=1)

```

The peak of the total surplus curve is where  where $P = MC$, at about £19.

## Estimating demand and optimal profit based on 'historical data' (presuming random firm 'price experimentation') {#demand-est-historical}

[This blog and vignette](https://www.r-bloggers.com/2017/08/pricing-optimization-how-to-find-the-price-that-maximizes-your-profit/) ([alternate link](https://insightr.wordpress.com/2017/08/27/pricing-optimization-how-to-find-the-price-that-maximizes-your-profit/)) appears to be an excellent marriage of microeconomic theory, data analysis and statistics, and business strategy. 

Have a look: I hope to incorporate this further.

## Introduction

We considered decisions under 'natural' uncertainty (known probability distributions), considering preferences and choices, and concepts such as 'expected utility' and 'risk aversion'.


\

Much of microeconomics also considers the prices and outcomes in markets with many individual consumers and firms. We consider concepts such as (Walrasian) equilibrium.

\

Now we also want to consider  $\rightarrow$  *Strategic* uncertainty: one "agent's" best choice may depend on what others choose, but each agent may be unsure about what others will choose.

\

Furthermore, we may have interactions among only a small number of agents, so (unlike in large markets) each agent's choice may affect the payoffs of other agents (and, in sequential games, may influence their choices).

\

$\rightarrow$ **Game Theory** is one of the the main approaches that Economists (and others) use to consider such situations, and what choices might be made.

\

Is game theory useful???

Some people [seem to think so](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/eyal-winter-739b6b44_if-you-have-economics-students-who-complain-activity-6595028520324472832-dbJa/?fbclid=IwAR2K_dmkK7vazjZa6GRa3ZtSMWXhgLE30Fe0wzZ1ezPzNibYG7_Q5hn5jog):

```

\



### Basic concepts (strategic interaction, elements of a game))


In 'large markets with many small players': Each individual (consumer, firm, etc) takes all others' choices as given

- market price, demand curve, etc.

<<br> \bigskip

Now: Consider 'strategic interaction'

- My best choice may depend on your choice
    - And vice versa

### What game theory can do (wet blanket) {-}

```

Game theory gives us a language and framework for analyzing strategic situations

The 'solution concepts' can be said to make 'predictions' under given assumptions.  The idea of 'equilibrium' is defined as a baseline.
\

Dr. Reinstein says: Sometimes overrated as a tool for predicting how people/firms will actually behave.

\


- It often makes multiple predictions, or predicts 'mixed strategies' (randomisation).

- Real-world and experimental choices are often/arguably predicted poorly by classical game theory.

- For example, standard game theory says chess has a pre-determined outcome and is a bit boring (ok, you may agree about the latter).

```{block2,  type='technote'}

Adv: But there are complicating issues making it difficult to asses the 'predictions' of game theory.

Particularly because monetary payoff may not be the same as utility payoffs ... this can make real-world predictions unclear.

Particularly if there are social preferences or fairness preferences. \


We also see failures to coordinate,
failure to take higher-order cognitive steps,
and preferences over the *manner decisions are made*.
These make Game Theoretic predictions difficult.

```


# Strategic games {#strat-games}

## Elements of a game {-}

**A 'strategic game'** (also called a 'normal-form game, I believe') must specify

1. Players,

2. Actions these players may choose, and

3. Payoffs resulting from the combination of players' choices

*Important note on interpretation of payoffs/preferences in game theory (unfold):*

```{block2,  type='fold'}


The 'utility' (payoff) to each player arising from the combination of each player's strategies (and chance) in the game

- May include both 'money earned' and other considerations; all this is summarised in the payoff numbers

- The goal of each player is to obtain the largest payoff that she can obtain (not just to 'win')

Note: E.g., each player prefers to get 2 in *utility* and have the other player get 8 than for both to get 1

Note: In this context it is typically not helpful to complain 'I don't think players will maximise their payoffs, because they also care about how others do, etc.' Whatever it is they care about can be expressed in the theoretical payoffs.\

However, these concerns are relevant to experiments that may incorrectly assume participants are maximising only their monetary payoffs.\


Also, there are also certain kinds of 'psychological' motivations that cannot be modeled in a straightforward way by payoffs. (see 'psychological games').

```

Main point: the payoffs depicted in a game should *include* psychological and fairness concerns.

I discuss this further in the supplement on behavioral economics and 'psychological payoffs' [here](#psych-payoffs).

<div class="marginnote">

[A Public Dilemma: Cooperation with Large
Stakes and a Large Audience](http://repository.essex.ac.uk/9979/1/dp617.pdf) ... offers an excellent example of how to apply this.

Game theoretical analysis of a game show game 'Golden Balls'; great use of game theory considering social preferences, applied to an empirical analysis. I have some slideson this [here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/zjpys23uyoblqr0/notesonbelotforclass_handout.pdf?dl=0).

\
```{block2,  type='inputq'}
1.  *Who are the players in Chicken?*

2. What are the actions (pure strategies) in Chicken?

3. What are the payoffs in Chicken?
```

```{block2,  type='fold'}

1.   The north-facing car 'North' and 2. the south-facing car 'South'

2.  For both N and S, two actions -- Pull-off, Straight.

3. Payoffs are a function of the action profile, discussed below
```

\

*Payoffs in 'Chicken'; what makes a game a 'game of Chicken?'*



- Both pull-off $\rightarrow$  Tie


- N Straight, S pulls off $\rightarrow$ N 'wins', S 'loses'

- N pulls off, S straight $\rightarrow$ N 'loses', S 'wins'


- Both straight $\rightarrow$ crash


\

*To meaningfully convey this game* (at least according to its standard characterization in Economics) payoffs must follow: Win $\succ$ tie  $\succ$ lose $\succ$ crash

\


Here is an example of payoffs that capture the essential strategic considerations in 'Chicken'.

*Payoffs are written as a matrix below: by convention, the 'Row' player's payoffs are specified first in each cell, followed by the Column player's payoffs*


```{r, echo=FALSE,message=FALSE}

library(magrittr)
library(kableExtra)

# Define Variables
W=1
L=-1
T=0
C=-10

# Assign Pairs
pair <- function(x,y) sprintf("(%d,%d)", x,y)
all_pairs <- c(pair(T,T), pair(W,L), pair(L,W), pair(C,C))
payoff.mat <- matrix(all_pairs, nrow=2)
dimnames(payoff.mat) <- c(rep(list(c("Pull off","Straight")), 2))
results = "asis"

# Plot
payoff.mat %>% kable() %>% kable_styling()


```


Note that what will matter are the *relative payoffs* and not the absolute levels... (at least, if we ignore 'mixed strategies' for now).

<div class="marginnote">
For another example of a game or 'category of 2x2 games', please see the famous [Prisoners' dillemma](#pd-normal), depicted below.
</div>


\


**O-R define the strategic game as a formal mathematical object:**

<div class="marginnote">

Remember that formal mathematical definitions help us avoid ambiguity, and allow us to use the 'general tools of maths' to construct proofs. E.g., 'fixed point theorems' can be applied to prove the existence of an equilibrium in some cases.

</div>


> A strategic game$\langle N , (A^i)_{i \in N}, (\succsim^i)_{i \in N} \rangle$ consists of

> players: a set $N = \{1,..., n\}$

(However, we will mostly consider 2-player games)

> actions: for each player $i \in N$ , a set $A_i$ of actions

This action set may be discrete (e.g., $A_i = \{Yes. No\}$) or continuous (e.g., a firm may choose a positive quantity $q$, so  $A_i = q \in R_+$).

\

> preferences: for each player $i \in N$, a preference relation $\succsim^i$ over the set $A = \times_{i \in N} A^i$ of action profiles.

I.e., each player has preferences over the 'outcome' of the game, the combination of actions chosen by each player (referred to as an 'action profile').

<div class="marginnote">
I believe the $\times_{i \in N}$ sign represents the 'Cartesian product', i.e., the set of all combinations of one of each element.

Note that preferences are defined *directly* over the set of action profiles, unlike in market models.
</div>


> A function $u_i : A \rightarrow  R$ that represents $\succsim^i$  is a payoff function for player $i$.

\

The 'Strategic game' form is typically used to depict simultaneous games; where all players make their choice at the same time (or if not at the same time, no players know the choices made by other players when their choices are made), with 'complete information' (all players know whom they are playing against, and what these players' payoffs are.)

\

With only two players and a finite number of actions, these games are often displayed using a matrix, such as (again) for the 'Chicken' game below.

\

```{r  fig.cap = 'A matrix depicting players actions and payoffs in the Chicken game', out.width='60%', fig.asp=.6, fig.align='center',  echo = FALSE}

 knitr::include_graphics("picsfigs/chicken-matrix.png")

```

\

In contrast, the *Extensive game* form is typically used to depict a game involving a (finite or infinite) *sequence* of choices made by players; we will return to this further below. Extensive-form games with a finite number of actions are often depicted using 'game trees', as in the 'simplified ultimatum game' below.

<div class="marginnote">
However, technically both simultaneous and sequential games can be depicted in either strategic form or extensive form. For an example, see the [prisoners dilemma depiction](#pd-normal) below.
</div>


```{r  fig.cap = 'Game tree - Simplified Ultimatum Game' , out.width='60%', fig.asp=.6, fig.align='center',  echo = FALSE}

\


## 'Individual optimization considerations'; best responses, 'rationalizability'


```{block2,  type='note'}

Note: O-R jump right into the definition of Nash Equilibrium (NE) at this point. I prefer to first introduce individual optimization and strategic considerations (unfold discussion of why). I introduce these concepts somewhat less formally than the O-R depict NE (but of course we *could* depict rationalizability more formally; I will give you some 'taste' of this).

In the fold below, I discuss this issue further.


```

```{block2,  type='fold'}

Nash Equilibrium (NE) does not automatically arise from players' optimization (nor from players' optimization under "common knowledge of rationality" which we will get to soon). Nash Equilibrium (NE) simply represents a "stable point" from which no player would want to 'deviate unilaterally'; however there multiple equilibria (or no 'pure strategy equilibrium'), and, particularly in the absence of communication, players may fail to coordinate on an equilibrium. Both may regret their actions, each having thought the other player would have made a different choice.

\

I prefer to begin by thinking about each individual player strategic considerations, and then to introduce the idea of 'Rationalizability' in a strategic context (calculated through 'iterated strict dominance', and potentially justified in a situation of 'common knowledge of rationality'. There are some connections between NE and Rationalizability; e.g., where there is a unique rationalizable outcome, it also represents a unique Nash Equilibrium. But they are fundamentally different concepts: Rationalizability represents the consequence of players optimizing, while NE simply represents a 'stable point'.

In Osborne and Rubinstein's 1994 text, 'A Course in Game Theory', they note:

> If the game is a one-shot event in which all players choose their actions simultaneously then it is not clear how each player can know the other players' equilibrium actions ... [as in NE... thus we consider solution concepts] In which players' believes about each other's actions are not assume to be correct but are constrained by considerations of rationality...

```


### Common knowledge

- What all players know, and
- all players know that all other players know,
- and all players know that all other players know that all other players know,
- and all players know that all other players know that all other players know that all other players know,

 etc.

*Note:* We always assume that the rules of the game are common knowledge.

\


Why is common knowledge important?

Note: The BR is a function of the others' strategies *S*; it may take a different value for each strategy the others play.

</div>


\


### Dominant, dominated strategies and rationalizability

<div class="marginnote">

Again, iterated strict dominance and rationalizability are NOT covered in the O-R text, but I want you to learn it.  As a prediction it is much easier to justify than Nash Equilibrium.

</div>

<br> \bigskip

Dominant strategy
:     A single strategy that is a best response to *any* of the other player’s strategies.

- A simple prediction: a 'rational' player will play a dominant strategy, if she has one.

\

Dominated strategy
:     Strategy A is dominated by strategy B if B yields higher payoffs for *any* of the other player’s strategies

- A simple prediction: a rational player will *never* play a dominated strategy

*Why?*: because a dominated strategy  cannot be optimal for *any* belief about what the other player(s) will do



<br> \bigskip

```{block2,  type='note'}

With only two strategies to choose among these concepts are the same.

With more than two, if there is a Dominant strategy this means that all other strategies are dominated by it. We see this in examples below.

```

\

```{block2,  type='inputq'}

What is the prediction of 'players play dominant strategies' in the Prisoner's dilemma"

Here it clearly predicts that both will confess. However, in some other games this concept may have no clear prediction.

<div class="marginnote">
Food for thought: if a player's Best response is unaffected by the other player's best response, is this really a game with "strategic interaction"?

Perhaps the Prisoner's Dillemma, arguably the most famous game, and one that dramatically illustrates the potential for group interest to depart from individual interest...  is a very boring game; if it's even meaningfully a game.  Whatever you choose has no bearing on whatever my best choice might be!

\

```{r  fig.cap = '', out.width='65%', fig.asp=.4, fig.align='center',  echo = FALSE}
 knitr::include_graphics(file.path("picsfigs","matrixforISD.png"))
```


<div class="inputq">

What does 'players play dominant strategies' predict above? What about 'players never play dominated strategies'?

</div>

\


### Rationalisability/ Iterated strict dominance

Extending this ...

**Rationality assumption:** the players are rational.

We know rational players will not play dominated strategies
The players *themselves* know this.

<br> \bigskip

**Common Knowledge of Rationality assumption:**

The players know all other players are rational. The players know all players know all players are rational.  The players know (all players know … ad infinitum) all players are rational.

- Thus the players know what the other players will never do, and eliminate these from consideration
- The players will not play a strategy if another strategy is always better against this reduced set of possibilities
- Etc.

This process is called 'Iterated Strict Dominance' (ISD) We will call strategies that survive ISD **'rationalizable' strategies**.

Rationalizability has a somewhat different conceptual justification than ISD, but they are closely related.

<div class="marginnote">
There are differences between 'rationalizable' and 'survives ISD' but for our purposes these are basically the same. At least in a finite strategic game (a finite number of actions), the set of (actions leading to) outcomes that survive ISD is the set of profiles of rationalizable actions.
</div>

A formal definition of rationalizability (From O-R 1994, p. 54):

```{block2,  type='fold'}

> An action $a_i \in A_i$ is *rationalizable* in the strategic game $\langle N, (A_i), (u_i)\rangle$

(this notation is similar to our notation, except that they are using a utility function $u_i$ to depict preferences)

> if for each $j \in N$ there is a set $Z_j \subseteq A_j$ such that

(a subset of the action space for *each* player... think of)

> $a_i \in Z_i$

($i$'s own action is in this set)

> [and] every action $a_j \in Z_j$ is a best response to a belief $\mu_j(a_j)$ whose support is a subset of $Z_{-j}$.

(The action is a best response to some belief about other players' actions ... where these actions are themselves best responses to some belief about other players' actions, where these actions are themselves...)

```


\

ISD example; may yield a unique prediction:

```{r  fig.cap = '', out.width='50%', fig.asp=.4, fig.align='center',  echo = FALSE}
 knitr::include_graphics(file.path("picsfigs","isd3.png"))
```


\

However, there may be *no* dominated strategies, or there may be *some*, but still ISD may leave many possibilities:

<br> \bigskip

### NE: Simple definition and discussion

```{block2,  type='note'}

I present a basic undergraduate-level explanation of this here. If this is already familiar an obvious to you, you may skip this and go right to the O-R reading.

If you are *not* familiar with this, you may find it helpful to read first before digging into the formal presentation.

```


Nash equilibrium (NE)
:     A set of *strategies*, one for each player, that are best responses against one another


- If I play my BR to your chosen strategy and you're playing your BR to mine, neither of us has an incentive to deviate --- an equilibrium.

- All *finite* games have at least one Nash equilibrium\*
    - But it may be an equilibrium in 'mixed strategies' (involving randomisation)

- Caveat: we might not expect such play to actually occur (particularly not in one-shot games)

<div class="marginnote">
\* However, games with infinite or non-compact action spaces need not have a Nash equilibrium in either pure or mixed strategies. Note that the O-R book defines Nash equilibrium separately from 'mixed strategy equilibrium'.

 In fact, two-player games will have an *odd* number of equilibria, at least if we include 'mixed strategy Nash Equilibria'; you can see this by looking at the crosses of the BR functions
</div>

### NE: Formal depiction

From O-R:


```{block2,  type='def'}

> In a strategic game $\langle N , (A^i)_{i \in N}, (\succsim^i)_{i \in N} \rangle$

> an action profile $a = (a^i) \in A$

(profile of actions: one action chosen for each player $i$)

>  is a Nash equilibrium if for every player $i \in N$ we have

> $(a^i, a^{−i}) \succsim^i (x^i , a^{−i})$ for all $x^i \in A_i$$


*Note*: $a^{−i}$ denotes 'the action chosen by all players other than player $i$'.

> where $(x^i , a^{−i})$ denotes the action profile that differs from $a$ only in that the action of individual $i$ is $x^i$ rather than $a^i$.

```

Thus, again, in the above definition,each player's action in action profile $a$ is a best response to the other players' actions ... because no other choice would make player $i$ better off, given what the others choose.

\

O-R similarly define a NE in terms of 'each player best responding' ... defining  $BR(a^{−i}) as "the set of player $i$’s best responses to $a^{-1}$ and "action profile $a$ is a Nash equilibrium if and only if $a^i \in BR(a^{−i})$ for each player $i$.

\

```{block2,  type='warning'}

For a NE:

1. These need not be *strict* best responses; each player may have more than one best response to the other players' choices in this strategy profile... all that it requires is that $a^i$  is among the best responses.


2. We do not ask 'If I changed my response and others correspondingly also changd their responses would I be better off'? (That would be closer to the Kantian equilibrium concept discussed in O-R). We just ask "if I change my response can I do better, given what others are doing." If the answer is 'no', then I am best responding. If the answer is 'no' for all players, then all are best responding to each other, and this profile is a Nash equilibrium.

3. Remember that a Nash equilibrium is a property of an  *action profile* (or a 'strategy profile'), with one action or strategy for each player. It is not, strictly speaking, a property of an outcome nor a property of a set of payoffs. We can state "the payoffs consistent with Nash equilibrium are" ... But we shouldn't state "the Nash equilibrium is that each player gets payoffs 10".


```


\

### Note on O-R characterization of 'Nash equilibrium' {#note-ne}

O-R define a "Nash Equilibrium in a strategic game" as involving 'pure strategies' only. No player is randomizing.

Going with this definition, they state:

>  some strategic games do not have a Nash equilibrium.

This contrasts with the definition I have seen previously. In most text, Nash equilibrium is define to allow either mixed or pure strategies.

\

They later define "Mixed strategy equilibrium" and they note (but do not prove here):

> every game in which each player’s set of actions is finite has a mixed strategy equilibrium.

As I said, I am more familiar with the definition of NE to include mixed strategies, does the above statement could be modified to be: "every game in which each player’s set of actions is finite has a Nash equilibrium, which may be in mixed strategies".

By the way, even among infinite games, a Nash equilibrium (or "mixed strategy equilibrium") is guaranteed to exist so long as the strategy sets are ["compact"](http://www-math.mit.edu/~djk/calculus_beginners/chapter16/section02.html) and the payoff functions are continuous.

```

\

## Examples of strategic games


Please consider all of the examples in O-R section 15.2-15.3, at least insofar as you find these interesting.

*These illustrate an array of interesting and fundamental concepts*:

\

We see:

-  Games where the NE (and indeed the unique rationalisable strategies) defy both intuition and 'actual play in experiments', and where the NE does *not* maximise the player's payoffs \*  -- (Traveler's dillemma, Prisoners' dillemma, price and quantity setting, see also the ['Keynesian Beauty contest'](https://web.stanford.edu/~niederle/GuessingGames.pdf) or problem 5 in O-R) ...

<div class="marginnote">
\* Although, as I mention elsewhere, in any interactive experiment it is hard to rule out that 'social preferences' may drive the results. We can only control the financial payoffs; we don't know what the "true payoffs" are if players care about other players or about fairness etc.
</div>

- Games with infinite strategy spaces (Traveller's game, Auctions, Location games, Price and quantity-setting games,... )

- Finite (matrix) games (Bach or Stravinsky, all the other ones where a matrix is displayed)

- Coordination games (Bach or Stravinsky, Coordination game)\*

- Anti-coordination games (Odds or evens, Matching pennies)

<div class="marginnote">

'Bach or Stravinsky' is usually called the 'Battle of the Sexes', and the choices are 'Ballet' (preferred by the 'Wife') and 'Boxing' ('Husband's' preference). Personally, I find this much easier to remember. If we want to subvert the stereotype here, We could think of the ballet as being extremely violent and the boxing match as a boxing match fought with feathers and balloons.

</div>


- Games where actions are 'strategic complements' (e.g., *Effort game*)

- Games where actions are 'strategic substitutes' (e.g., *Cournot quantity-setting game*)

\

These also present strategic insights at the core of several theory-heavy applied fields, such as

- Auction Theory: *First-price and Second-price auctions*

- Industrial Organization (firm strategy and antitrust): *Location game* (aka 'Hotelling model'), *Quantity-setting* (Cournot), *Price Setting* (Bertrand), War of attrition (presented later)

- Development economics and the study of cooperation: *Effort Game*,


*Other examples are given in the practice problems; these involve legitimately interesting and relevant examples, not simply 'busy work'*

\

```{block2,  type='note'}

Note that I skip several sections of O-R here,  for time considerations. I skip:

- Existence of a Nash equilibrium (see also my note [above](#note-ne) on O-R's unusual terminology). You may nonetheless find this worth reading, particularly if you love maths. The definition and discussion of 'supermodular games' is also fairly relevant; it comes up a bit in the literature.

- Strictly competitive games (i.e., 'zero sum games') ... have a look at the definition at least

- Kantian equilibrium (a very interesting non-standard concept!)

```


## Mixed strategy (Nash) equilibrium of strategic games

### Simple presentation

```{block2,  type='note'}

I present a basic undergraduate-level explanation of this here. If this is already familiar an obvious to you, you may skip this and go right to the O-R discussion of mixed strategy equilibrium. However, if you are *not* familiar with this, you may find it helpful to read first before digging into the formal presentation.

```

\

*Note*: I use the terminology of 'pure and mixed strategies' (slightly different from O-R) here

Pure strategy
:     Consists of a single action played with certainty

<br> \bigskip

Mixed strategy
:     Assigns a probability to each possible action

<br> \bigskip

*Remember: as claimed [above](#note-ne), in finite games (and a wide class of infinite games) there is always at least one NE. If there is no pure strategy NE, there will be a NE in mixed strategies.*

\

### Matching pennies: mixed strategies {-}

**Intuition**

If you choose heads/tails half the time then I'm indifferent between heads or tails. Thus, choosing 'heads' half the time is *among* my best responses.

If I choose heads half the time then you're indifferent between heads/tails. Thus choosing heads half the time is *among* your best responses

So, technically, each of us choosing heads half the time is a NE.

<div class="marginnote">
But it is called a 'weak' NE because either of us would do no *worse* if he deviated alone.

 knitr::include_graphics(file.path("picsfigs","bosmatrix.png"))
```

*Note:* Wife wants to end up at the same place as her husband but doesn’t know where he is going.\

- If she believes that he will always go to the ballet she should always go to the ballet.\

- If she believes he will always go boxing, she should go boxing.\

- What other beliefs may she have?

We want to derive the best response functions, and find the intersection(s) of these.

Let $h$ represent the probability husband chooses Ballet


```{r  fig.cap = 'Source: Nicholson and Snyder', out.width='75%', fig.asp=.4, fig.align='center',  echo = FALSE}
 knitr::include_graphics(file.path("picsfigs","bosmatrix.png"))
```
\

**Wife's BR:**

- Wife chooses Ballet iff her Expected payoff of Ballet > Expected payoff of Boxing

<br> \bigskip


I.e., $2h > 1- h$, i.e, $h > 1/3$

Thus, wife goes to Ballet if she believes husband goes to Ballet more than 1/3 of the time

- If she thinks he goes below 1/3 of the time she goes to Boxing

- If she thinks he goes *exactly* 1/3 of the time she is indifferent


\

```{r  fig.cap = '', out.width='70%', fig.asp=.4, fig.align='center',  echo = FALSE}
 knitr::include_graphics(file.path("picsfigs","wife_br.png"))
```

*Note:* This plots the value of w that best responds to h;\ the probability the wife goes Ballet given the probability the husband goes Boxing.

\

Let $w$ denote the probability wife chooses Ballet

\

**Husband's BR:**

<br> \bigskip


Husband chooses Ballet iff his Expected payoff of Ballet > Expected payoff of Boxing

$$1w > 2- 2w$$, i.e., $$w > 2/3$$ ... for these payoffs


Thus, husband goes to Ballet if he believes wife goes Ballet more than 2/3 of the time

- If he thinks she goes less than 2/3 of the time he goes to Boxing

- If she thinks he goes *exactly* 2/3 of the time he is indifferent


```{block2,  type='technote'}
 Note that now that we are considering mixed strategies the ratios of the payoffs may matter in computing the equilibrium mixing probabilities, and not only 'which is larger'. Recall that this also was the case when we considered expected utility over uncertain outcomes.

```

\


```{r  fig.cap = '', out.width='70%', fig.asp=.4, fig.align='center',  echo = FALSE}
 knitr::include_graphics(file.path("picsfigs","wh_br.png"))
```


```{r  fig.cap = '', out.width='70%', fig.asp=.4, fig.align='center',  echo = FALSE}
 knitr::include_graphics(file.path("picsfigs","bos_3_eq.png"))
```


*Shortcut to computing this:* only someone who is indifferent will randomise. (Otherwise they must strictly prefer one or the other action, so 'mixing these' cannot be optimal.)

\

Above, $h=1/3$ makes wife indifferent, $w=2/3$ makes husband indifferent


\

### What's all this rot? {-}

Do people really "randomize their choices"?

```{r  fig.cap = '', out.width='50%', fig.asp=.5, fig.align='center',  echo = FALSE}
 knitr::include_graphics("picsfigs/doctors_mixing_cartoon.png")
```


\


Mixed strategies are not about 'being unpredictable', in spite of what some texts say ; these are one-shot games!

\


Some texts and authors make this point about 'unpredictability' but others disagree (including myself). Making sure that it is impossible to predict your later play from your previous is only important if you are playing the same game repeatedly, and being observed.

\

```{block2,  type='note'}

It makes a bit more sense if we think about 'populations.

Suppose in a population 1/3 of men go to Ballet and 2/3 of women go to Ballet:
... these ratios are 'stable'; no reason for systematic changes.
On the other hand, if men always went to boxing and women to ballet this is not stable. A husband would be better off going to ballet ... so the ratios should change over time.

This interpretation is presented and defended in more detail in O-R sections 15.7 and 15.8.

```

\

### Computing payoffs with mixing {-}

Remember, formally, a  NE specifies *strategies* (strategy 'profiles') not payoffs

In the BOS the pure strategy equilibria were

- i. Husband: Boxing, Wife: Boxing
- ii. Husband: Ballet, Wife: Ballet

\

The mixed-strategy NE was:

-  iii. Husband: go Ballet with probability h=1/3, Wife: Go Ballet with prob w=2/3.

The *payoffs* to these were, respectively

i. Husband: 2, Wife: 1

ii. Husband: 1, Wife: 2

iii. ... ??

\

Payoff to the mixed strategy:

Payoffs are utilities: thus under the Expected Utility model we sum the utility of each outcome $\times$ probability of that outcome

- Prob(Both go Ballet) = $w \times h = \frac{2}{3} \times \frac{1}{3} = \frac{2}{9}$
- Prob(Both go Boxing) = $(1-w)(1-h) = \frac{1}{3} \times \frac{2}{3} = \frac{2}{9}$
- Prob(Wife Ballet, Husband Boxing) = $w(1-h) = \frac{2}{3} \times \frac{2}{3} = \frac{4}{9}$
- Prob(Wife Boxing, Husband Ballet) = $(1-w)(h) = \frac{1}{3} \times \frac{1}{3} = \frac{1}{9}$

<br> \bigskip

Thus, under the mixed strategy NE play:

$$U_{husb} =  \frac{2}{9} \times 1 +  \frac{2}{9} \times 2 +  \frac{4}{9} \times 0 + \frac{1}{9} \times 0 = \frac{6}{9} = \frac{2}{3}$$
$$U_{wife} = \frac{2}{3}$$

(The wife's payoffs can be  inferred from symmetry of problem, or they can be similarly calculated.)


\


### Mixed Strategy: More formal presentation {#formal-mix}


*I love O-R's motivation for this* ... it makes a lot more sense than the usual characterisation of mixing (as well as for Nash Equilibrium)

Considering (e.g.) the Matching Pennies game (look it up to get this in your head)...

> from time to time, an individual is drawn randomly from each population and these two individuals play the game.

Some share of individuals in each population choose each action.

> We are interested in steady states in which each individual’s belief
about the distribution of actions in the other population is correct (perhaps because of his long experience playing the game) and each individual chooses his best action given these beliefs.

Note...\*

<div class="marginnote">

\* But note this need not be a 'strictly' best action ... there may be a tie. In fact, in any 'Mixed strategy equilibrium', all players who are mixing (equivalently, all 'populations in a certain role' where some share of the population chooses a certain action) ... each player must be *indifferent* between the actions she mixes among, given what other players are doing.
</div>


If the game has no (pure strategy) NE then "no configuration of choices in which all members of each population choose the same action is stable".

In 'Matching Pennies', if exactly half of all players in the population (on either side ... the game is symmetric) play 'Heads' this is "stable"; no player can do any better by changing her choice.\*

\

Formally (O-R definition)

```{block2,  type='def'}

> Given a strategic game ... a *mixed strategy* for player $i$ is
a probability distribution over $A_i$.


> A mixed strategy $\alpha_i$ that is concentrated on one action (i.e. $\alpha^i(a^i) = 1$ for some $a^i \in A^i$) is a *pure strategy*

```

With countable actions a mixed strategy $\alpha_i$ of player $i$ assigns a probability $\alpha^i(a^i)$ to each possible action.  O-R's preferred interpretation ... "$\alpha^i(a^i)$ as the proportion of population $i$ that chooses the action $a_i$."

\

O-R point out that the standard interpretation of this involves EU preferences. Thus

> we specify the preferences of each player $i$ in a strategic game by giving a Bernoulli function $u_i$ whose expected value represents the player’s preferences over lotteries over action profiles...



\

To avoid the use of integrals, O-R define the *mixed strategy equilibrium* here for finite or countably infinite games only:

```{block2,  type='def'}

> Let  $G = \langle N, (A^i)_{i \in N}, (u^i) i \in N \rangle$ ...

> a  profile $(\alpha^i$)_{i \in N}$

(Remember -- this assigns a probability to each action ... for each player)

> is a *mixed strategy equilibrium* of $G$ if ... [for every player and every action $a_i$ assigned positive probability]

> $i$’s expected payoff...  from $a_i$ given $\alpha^{−i}$

(rem: $\alpha^{−i}$ is the strategy of all other players)

> is at least as high as his expected payoff from $x_i$ given $\alpha^{-i}$ for any $x^i \in A^i$.

```

... so every action played with positive probability in a *mixed strategy equilibrium* must be at least as good as any other action given the actions of others.  This also accords with the 'population interpretation': every individual in the population must be happy with her action choice.

\

This is a very important concept across a wide range of domains from biology to business strategy to law and politics.

## Supplement: Finding NE in continuous games; example -- the 'Tragedy of the commons'


```{block2,  type='note'}

A general method for finding NE for continuous games with differentiable payoffs, finding NE:

1. Write down payoff functions. (Differentiable? If not it becomes more difficult.)

2. Maximize each player’s payoff with respect to own strategy; the other player's payoff are a fixed 'parameter' here $\rightarrow$ Players' best-response functions.

3. Look for intersection(s) $\rightarrow$ Nash equilibrium (equilibria)

```


<div class="marginnote">
Source: https://www3.nd.edu/~tjohns20/gametheory_SP13/slides3.pdf}
</div>


<br>  \bigskip


With two players:

$$s_i^\ast=B_i(B_-i(s_i^\ast))$$

If the game is symmetric this is a 'fixed point'.



\

### Tragedy of the Commons example

Shepherds A and B raise $s_A$ and $s_B$ sheep, respectively, in the same meadow

- More sheep graze $\rightarrow$ the less grass for each, thus less wool/milk/meat per sheep

Benefit from each sheep raised: $120-s_A-s_B$

\

Total benefit from raising $s_A$ and $s_B$ sheep:

- Shepherd A:	$s_A(120-s_A-s_B)$
- Shepherd B:	$s_B(120-s_A-s_B)$

\
Marginal benefit of 'me adding' another sheep:

- Shepherd A:	$120-2s_A-s_B$
- Shepherd B:	$120-s_A-2s_B$


\

For simplicity, assume zero marginal cost. Set the marginal benefit equal to the marginal cost (here zero)

- Shepherd A:	$120-2s_A-s_B = 0$
- Shepherd B:	$120-s_A-2s_B = 0$

Rearrange the above to solve for the best response functions

- Shepherd A:	 $s_A = 60-\frac{1}{2} s_B$
- Shepherd B:	 $s_B = 60-\frac{1}{2} s_A$

\


Solve for the Nash equilibrium:

$$s_A = 60-\frac{1}{2} s_B$$

\

Plug this value of $s_A$ into the BRF for B and solve for $s_B$, then for $s_A$

$$s_B = 60-\frac{1}{2} s_A = 60 - \frac{1}{2}(60-\frac{1}{2} s_B)$$

$s_A* = s_B* = 40$


\

```{r  fig.cap = '', out.width='80%', fig.asp=.4, fig.align='center',  echo = FALSE}
 knitr::include_graphics(file.path("picsfigs","brsheep.png"))
```

- Shepherd A:	 $s_A = 60-\frac{1}{2} s_B$

- Shepherd B:	 $s_B = 60-\frac{1}{2} s_A$
- $\rightarrow s_A* = s_B* = 40$


\

**Why the “Tragedy” of the Commons?**

*Some examples...*


- Firms choose a price or quantity of a product, or a level of R\&D, etc.
- Households voluntarily contribute to a local public good (e.g., neighborhood watch), or choose how many fish to catch from the shared pond
- Nations decide how large an army to build

$\rightarrow$ Payoff functions, continuous 'best response functions'; rather than a payoff matrix


\


To maximise *total* payoffs we set $S=s_A+s_B$ to maximise
$$S\times(120-S)$$

Concave problem, set first-derivative to zero:
$$120 - 2S = 0 \rightarrow S^*=60$$

\

Leading to total payoff $60 \times (120 - 60) = 3600$.
- If they split this evenly (each graze 30), they get 1800 each.
- This is the 'continuous' action analogy of the Prisoner's dilemma

- If split evenly (each graze 30), get 1800 each.
- This is the 'continuous' action analogue of Prisoner's dilemma

\


Note that both the PD and the above 'tragedy of the commons' game illustrate a similar point:  *Individuals acting in their own private interest may end up each doing worse off than if they could cooperate or collude.*

\

*Sadly, this problem (literally!) is still relevant.*  See, e.g., ["Morocco: Managing the 'commons' Livestock and Pasture Development Project in the Eastern Region"]({http://www.ifad.org/evaluation/public_html/eksyst/doc/profile/pn/morocco.htm)

```

\

### Again -- "Strategic complements" and "strategic substitutes"


The slope of these 'best response functions' tells you whether the two players 'choice variables' (above, sheep) are **Strategic complements** or **Strategic substitutes**.



(Of course, we can also have 'strategic heterogeneity'... strategic substitutes starting from some points, some combinations of strategies in the 'strategy space'  strategic complements starting from other points.)


"Continuous Action" games  allow us to see how the equilibrium shifts as we change one 'parameter'. E.g., increase A's benefit per sheep .We call this 'comparative statics analysis'. Further discussion...

```{block2,  type='fold'}


Comparative statics can be applied more generally and even in much more abstract games and situations. Sometimes we can derive comparative statics properties of equilibria (or "monotone comparative statics" where we do not allow jumps between equilibria) even when we cannot solve for the equilibria themselves!

```



## Supplement: Prisoners’ Dillemma in Normal and extensive form {#pd-normal}

*The original story*:

> Two individuals are arrested for a crime.  They both know that they can only be convicted for a lesser crime, for which they get 2 years in jail. DA (Chief Crown Prosecutor) puts them in separate rooms and offers each the same deal. If you confess and your partner stays quiet you will only get 1 year in jail and they will get 10 years.

If you both confess you will each get 3 years.

Two Players: (A and B, row and column, whatever)


Strategies (Actions): 'Cooperate' (C) or defect (D)

all_pairs <- c(pair("R","R"), pair("T","S"), pair("S","T"), pair("P","P"))

dimnames(payoff.mat) <- c(rep(list(c("Cooperate","Defect")), 2))
results = "asis"

# Plot

```

To be a prisoner's dilemma game the payoffs must satisfy $T > R > P > S$

I.e., Temptation $>$ Reward $>$ Punishment $>$ Sucker

\


### The Prisoners’ Dilemma: Extensive form {#pd-extensive}

We can depict the same game in another format which we call the 'extensive form':

```{r  fig.cap = '', out.width='85%', fig.asp=.4, fig.align='center',  echo = FALSE}

knitr::include_graphics(file.path("picsfigs","pd_extensive.png"))

```

\

Above: the oval (usually this is given as dashed lines) depict the  'information set'/

Sequential move games *without* knowledge of previous moves are essentially equivalent to simultaneous move games.
Here, B may 'move second' but he doesn't know A's move (in the graphic above, he doesn't know "which side he is on"), so it's as if this is simultaneous.

\

Order only matters if you observe the earlier action.

### Multiple equilibrium and refinements {-}

We refer to *refinement criteria* and *focal points*. For example...

1. 'Choose the equilibrium with the highest payoffs for both?'  In BOS this rules out mixing (payoffs 2/3, 2/3 for h,w respectively).
But it doesn't say whether we should predict Box, Box (payoffs 2,1) or Ballet, Ballet (payoffs 1,2)

2. Choose the 'symmetric equilibrium?' ... here, mixing

3. Choose the one that seems like a 'focal point'? (remember the 'big game')


\

# Extensive form games (and sequential games) {#extensive}

Any game can be modeled as either a Strategic (AKA 'normal form') game or as an *Extensive Game* (AKA 'Extensive Form'). A key difference: in Strategic games we simply consider a set of actions or strategies, while in Extensive games we map  a "history", and we may consider the "sub-games" starting at any point in this history.

For situations that occur with sequential moves over time, where players alternate making choices, it may be simplest to depict these using a "game tree" such as the one below for the 'entry game' (formally an 'arborescence' with 'nodes and branches') and simpler to think of these as extensive form games.

\

<center>

![Entry game](picsfigs/entry_game_tree.png){ width=80% }

</center>


*Note: Game trees can also depict simultaneous choices or a mix of simultaneous and sequential choices.*:


```{block2,  type='fold'}

The sequentiality of the choice only matters if the later mover is observing the previous decision. Thus, we can depict an "as if simultaneous" choice  by "connecting the information set" in a game tree.

See, for example, the 'Rock paper scissors' (anticoordination) simultaneous game below:

![rocks-paper-scissors](picsfigs/rps_extensive.png)

\

More graphically:

![rocks-paper-scissors](picsfigs/rps_standard.png)



The dashed line indicates 'at the  time that player to his choosing rocks paper or scissors, she does not know whether player one has chosen rocks paper or scissors').

\

But we could also have 'sequential rocks paper scissors', perhaps a dumb game:


![rocks-paper-scissors](picsfigs/sequential_rps.png)


```

![rocks-paper-scissors](picsfigs/rps_extensive.png)




<!-- Add: example of a  complicated sequential game  depicted in a matrix -->
\

So, we can depict games in either format: the Strategic form (which we formally defined in the last section) or the Extensive form, as is convenient.\*

<div class="marginnote">
\* Note that it is easy to depict and to analyze most extensive form games with a game tree  and concepts such as "backwards induction".  However the formal representation of extensive form games is somewhat cumbersome, but we nonetheless introduce it below,  along with formal concepts such as subgame perfection.
</div>


<div class="marginnote">

'Complete contingent strategies':

“Imagine a player wishes to leave explicit instructions to some
agent” concerning how to play on his/her behalf.

– Note: This is not the same as a *commitment*.

</div>


However there is an important difference in the analysis of extensive form and strategic games. Some strategies may prescribe actions that may be optimal responses to another player's strategy if we 'start from the beginning' (or from an earlier stage of the game); however, if we were to actually reach the part of the game that prescribes such an action,  the action would no longer be optimal.  we may want to rule out such strategies involving "incredible threats" or "time inconsistent behavior". The Strategic form does not consider the sequence of the game, so it cannot address this; here we need the Extensive Form.



<div class="marginnote">

There may be other important differences in the analysis of the Extensive vs. Strategic representations of the games.  The Extensive form also makes it easier to consider imperfect and incomplete information; where earlier actions are not observed by later players, and where there are random components to payoffs.

\

The Extensive form (and tree depiction)  did make it convenient for me to consider the 'information sets at the end of the game'  and to depict payoffs adjusted for 'Losing Face' in a fancy game where  payoffs depend on information sets themselves. [@gallLosingFace2020]

</div>

```{block2,  type='note'}

O-R depict extensive games and subgame perfection (subgame perfect equilibrium) rather formally, with somewhat cumbersome notation.   We will cover most of this [below](#ext-formal).

But first, I present a simple depiction.

```


## Extensive form and subgame perfection: simple depiction {#repeated-games}

How does the Battle of Sexes game change if Wife chooses first, Husband observes her choice, and then he chooses

```{block2,  type='inputq'}

What do you think will happen?

- A. Wife: Ballet, Husband: Box
- B. Wife: Ballet, Husband: Ballet
- C. Wife: Box, Husband: Ballet
- D. Wife: Box, Husband: Box

```


```{r  fig.cap = '', out.width='70%', fig.asp=.4, fig.align='center',  echo = FALSE}

knitr::include_graphics(file.path("picsfigs","BOS_sequential.png"))

```

*Remember, it's a one-shot game ... unrealistic within a marriage of course*


- The wife has two strategies: Ballet or Boxing
- The husband has four contingent strategies, but we focus on what he will do in each of his two possible 'decision nodes'


*Here we see there is a 'first-mover advantage'.* (Unfold)

```{block2,  type='fold'}

It is better to be the first-mover than the second mover in such a game. If we switched the order, the wife would likely become better off and the husband worse off.

We see a very similar strategic concern in other contexts, including 'which firm enters a market first'. Suppose that if two firms are in a market there will be a price war with consumers as well as a bidding up of input prices and salaries,  and both will lose money. Perhaps by being the first firm to enter I 'scare off the other firm' and I can keep the profits. The other firm may 'threaten to enter' but that would seem to be a non-credible threat! On the other hand, suppose that I know that if I enter first the other firm can 'learn from my mistakes' and free-ride off my innovation. Here we would have a 'second-mover advantage'; but in such a game a BWI may lead to the outcome 'neither firm enters'!

```

\

These concerns also apply to politics, and the games can of course include multiple players ...

```{block2,  type='inputq'}

Can you think of some examples?

```

```{block2,  type='fold'}

Some example from  2018... can you think of comparable examples from today?

- Cameron's decision to allow a referendum, followed by politician's (Boris etc) decisions to choose a side?

- May's negotiations with the EU (Barnier), followed by the parliament's 'meaningful vote', followed by ??

- US Supreme court fight over Brett Kavanaugh, the sequential decisions of the last 'swing' senators

-  [UCU decision to declare and continue a strike, USS decision to award pay increases commensurate with inflation](https://exeterucu.wordpress.com/2019/10/26/strike-ballots-letter-to-students/)

```

\



Proper subgame (informal definition)

:     Part of the game tree including an initial decision not connected to another (in an oval or dashed lines) and everything branching out below it.

- I.e., each 'game' starting from a point where a player knows where he is (knows previous choices).\*

<div class="marginnote">

As noted earlier, if we want to consider imperfect information we may want to consider 'informations sets', and we can connect several nodes to indicate 'the player doesn't know at which node she is, because she doesn't know what the previous player(s) did

</div>



```{block2,  type='note'}

We can derive the *outcomes consistent with* SPNE via backwards induction.

Essentially, SPNE simply requires that each players (choose strategies that specify) would act optimally at each of the point they might find themselves... i.e., at each of the decision nodes in the extensive form 'game tree.'

```

\

*Is 'backwards induction' enough?*`

```{block2,  type='fold'}

To some extent this is the all of finite extensive games

BUT:

- Yields no prediction with indifference,

- No prediction with an infinite/indefinite horizon
- Unclear what it predicts with imperfect information.


BWI is similar to an iterated dominance prediction, where a player only plays actions that are dominant in each subgame, but in what sense is does it yield an equilibrium?

So maybe we need further concepts such as 'subgame perfection'

```
\


Subgame-Perfect Nash Equilibrium (SPNE)
:     Strategies that form a Nash equilibrium on every proper subgame.

You can solve for the *outcomes consistent with this with 'backwards induction' (BWI)

Solve for best move for last decision node (proper subgame)

- Given these, solve for best response for previous decision node

- Etc.

Note that the SPNE in a sequential game always involves 'best responses'. I think this makes SPNE more credible as a prediction in sequential games than "NE in simultaneous games", as we don't require coordination.

## 'Repeated games' ... a form of sequential games (simple depiction)

One form of sequential game is called a "repeated game"

Repeated game: A simultaneous 'stage' game that is played some finite or infinite (or indefinite) number of times. The payoffs are the sum of the payoffs in each "stage game" (with possible discounting to reflect time preferences).



### Definite time horizon {-}

- Is there a way in which we can sustain cooperation in a finitely repeated Prisoners’ Dilemma?
    - No.


\

Suppose we repeat the Prisoners’ Dilemma a finite (T) number of times, e.g., 10 times.

<br> <br> \bigskip


What is the outcome consistent with subgame perfect equilibrium?

Via Backwards Induction (BWI) :
    - In period 10 (period T) both players confess as it's the dominant strategy
    - In period 9 (period T-1)
        - Knowing period 10 (period T) decision is unaffected by earlier moves, players confess in period 9 (their dominant strategy)
    - ... etc, all the way back to period 1


<br> <br> \bigskip
Thus each player will Confess in every period.  Not possible to sustain cooperation.


### Trigger strategies

Trigger strategy
:     Strategy in a repeated game where one player stops cooperating in order to punish another player for not cooperating.


Grim trigger strategy
:     If the other player fails to cooperate in one period, play the (undominated) action that makes her worse off in all later periods


### Repeated Games: Indefinite or infinite time horizon

- Game is played repeated for a potentially infinite number of periods
- But there is a 'discount factor' $g$
    - $g$ may represent the 'probability the game is repeated another time'

<div class="marginnote">

Note: With an infinitely-repeated game with no discounting, payoffs would be potentially infinite, making it hard to decipher. It's realistic to imagine people discount the future, and we don't know how long these repeated interactions last; people die, move away, etc.

</div>

\

<div class="marginnote">

*At this point it is worth a quick revision of what 'discount factors' mean.* This is a basic concept in Economics and Finance. I discuss this in a prior section [on 'time preferences'](#time-pref), but it is more fully discussed elsewhere. In particular, see  McDL: 13.3 on ‘dynamic choice’.

\

Note that there are some debates over whether it makes sense to 'discount utility'... we can see this discounting as simply an easy notation in these repeated games.

</div>


\


**Indefinitely repeated Prisoners' Dilemma**

Consider the following trigger strategy (for both players):

- Stay silent as long as the other player stays silent.
- If one player confesses, both players will confess from them on.
- Is this a SPNE?
    - In each subgame after someone confesses, we play confess in all stage games (forever on), which we know is a NE
    - What about periods where no one has confessed (yet)?


How do we know both players playing 'confess forever' is a SPNE?

Starting in any subgame, knowing the other player will confess, I will want to confess (for that period's payoffs).

I also know that given his strategy, playing 'silent' in  this period will not have any impact on my later payoffs.

\



The payoff from staying Silent (cooperating) each period is:

$$-2 \times (1 + g + g^2 + g^3 + ...  )$$



The payoff from Confessing right away (after which both players Confess always) is:

$$ -1 + -3 \times (g + g^2 + g^3 + ... ) $$

<br> <br> \bigskip

Formula for a geometric series (where $0<g<1$): $g + g^2 +  g^3 + g^4 ... = g/(1-g)$

```{block2,  type='note'}

The standard derivation of this is pretty neat; if you are not familiar, the Khan Academy (as usual) presents a pretty good explanation of this [HERE](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/ap-calculus-bc/bc-series-new/bc-10-2/a/proof-of-infinite-geometric-series-formula)

This formula is an important one in Economics (and beyond), particularly for discounting a constant stream of payoffs, e.g., stock dividends

```
\

Thus cooperation in a single period is 'weakly preferred' (at least as good) if

$$(-2) \times (1 + g + g^2 + g^3 +... ) \geq (-1) + -3 \times (g + g^2 + g^3 + ...)$$

<br> <br> \bigskip

$$g + g^2 + g^3 + ... \geq 1$$\*

<div class="marginnote">

\* Intuition for the second formula: left side is loss of future payoffs (-3 vs -2 forever from next period).

The right side is gain in that period (get -1 rather than -2))

</div>
\

$$g/(1-g) \geq 1$$

\

$$g \geq \frac{1}{2}$$


<br> <br> \bigskip


So, cooperation can be sustained as long as the probability of play continuing is high enough; here, above 1/2.


<div class="marginnote">
1. Just because it can be sustained doesn't mean it will be; there are other Subgame-Perfect Nash equilibria, including 'always confess'.

2. This setup is directly applied to the case of 'a cartel' of firms tacitly or overtly colluding to sustain high prices!

</div>



## Extensive games (formal, following O-R) {#ext-formal}


<center>

![Entry game](picsfigs/entry_game_tree.png){ width=50% }
</center>


Introducing 'histories' (O-R), considering the figure above:

> We refer to each sequence of actions as a history. In [the entry game] there are five histories. The initial node [red square] represents the null history: no action has yet been chosen.

> The node shown by a small [blue] disk represents the history (In).

> Each of the three other histories, (In, Accomodate), (In,Fight), and (Out), leads to an endpoint of the game. We refer to these histories as terminal, and to the other histories, after which a player has to choose an action, as nonterminal.


\


O-R's formal definition:

<div class="marginnote">
Warning, much of this may seem obvious and excessively mathematically formal. This comes from wanting to define every concept from the simplest possible set of axioms.
</div>



```{block2,  type='def'}

> A (finite horizon) extensive game  $\langle N, H, P, (\succsim^i)_{i \in N} \rangle$  has the following components.

Note that the 'action sets' for each player are replaced by histories (H) and player functions (P).  The histories will contain and specify actions.

> Players: A set of players N = {1,...,n}. [as in strategic games]

\

> **Histories**

> A set H of histories, each of which is a finite sequence of actions. The empty history, $\emptyset$, is in $H$,

$\emptyset$ is the 'null history' ... 'nothing has happened yet'

> ... and if $(a_1,a_2,...,a_t) \in  H$ then also $(a_1,a_2,...,a_{t−1}) \in H$

In other words, the set of histories $H$ is the sets of all possible 'specifications of points' we could get to in the process of playing the game ... so if we can get to a later point in a sequence we can get to an earlier point.

> (We use the notation ($h, a_1,...,a_t$) for the history that starts with the history $h$ and continues with the actions $a_1,...,a_t)$.

> A history $h \in H$ is terminal if there is no $x$ such that $(h, x) \in H$.

I.e.,  if there is no sequence with all of the elements in $h$ and also additional elements. "Nothing more can happen... thus we are at the end point."

> The set of terminal histories is denoted $Z$.

\

> **Player function**

> A function $P : H \backslash Z \rightarrow N$ , the player function, which assigns a player to each nonterminal history (the player who moves after the history).

In other words 'whose turn is it?' or 'who has the move?'.

("$H \backslash Z$"  is set theory notation for all elements of set $H$ that are not in set $Z$.)

\

> **Preferences**

> For each player $i \in N$, a preference relation $\succsim^i$ over $Z$.

This is nearly as in the strategic, but now preferences are over 'terminal histories'. A combination of strategies for each player will lead to a unique terminal history.

```

\

O-R:

> ... capturing a situation in which every player, when choosing an action, knows all actions previously chosen. For this reason, the model is usually called an extensive game with perfect information.


If some earlier actions were *not* observed by other players later in the game, we would need to specify what the player knows using the terminology of "information sets". If time permits, we will return to this in section \@ref{incomp-info}.

\

**For the entry game we have:**

Players:
$N=\{1,2\}$ (or $N= \{\text{Challenger}, \text{Incumbent}\}$)

\

Set of histories:
$H =\{\emptyset,(Out),(In),(In,Cooperate),(In,Fight)\}$

Note that, e.g., '(Out, Cooperate)' is *not* a history in the set, as, if the first player does not enter, the second player does not ever 'have the turn to act'.

\

Terminal histories: $Z =\{(Out),(In,Cooperate),(In, Fight)\}$


\

Player functions ... who 'has the move': $P(\emptyset)= 1$ and $P(\text{In})=2$.

I.e., player 1 (challenger) moves first, i.e., after no previous actions. After history 'In' then player 2 (incumbent) 'has the move'.

\

Preferences over histories (over the outcomes of histories):

$(In, Cooperate) \succ^1 (Out) \succ^1 (In, Fight)$ (for player 1, the challenger)

$(Out) \succ^2 (In, Cooperate) \succ^2 (In, Fight)$ (for player 2, the incumbent)

\

**Strategies**

> a player’s strategy specifies the action she chooses for every history after which she moves, even histories that do not occur if she follows her strategy.

<div class="marginnote">

We can also display an 'abbreviated form'; figure \@ref(longgame-matrix)  vs. \@ref(longgame-matrix-abbrev) illustrates the difference.

</div>


Formally (O-R):

```{block2,  type='def'}

> A strategy of player $i$ .... is  a function that assigns to every [nonterminal] history $h \in H \backslash Z$ for which $P(h) = i$

(...wherever 'player $i$ has the move after the history $h$')

> an action in $\{x: (h,x) \in H\}$, the set of actions available to her after $h$.

('$(h,x)$' denotes the history with a sequence of actions $h$ followed by one more action $x$. Yes this is cumbersome.)

```


 \

A 'strategy profile' is a collection of strategies, one for each player. "Each strategy profile generates a unique terminal history."


Formally:

```{block2,  type='def'}

> Let $s$ be a strategy profile for the extensive game ...

> The terminal history generated by $s$ is $(a_1,...,a_T)$

> where $a_1 = s^{P(\emptyset)}(\emptyset)$

'$a_1$', the 'first action in the history', is the action specified in the strategy ($s$) ...

chosen by the 'player who has the move after the null history' (${P(\emptyset)}$)

...that is specified to be played after the null history (hence the $\emptyset$ argument in $s^{P(\emptyset)}(\emptyset)$.

\

> and $a_{t+1} = s^{P(a_1,...,a_t)}(a_1, ... , a_t )$ for $t = 1,... , T − 1$

Which is the action specified in the strategy for the player who 'has the move' after every other history prior to the terminal history.


```

### Formal: 'Regular' Nash Equilibrium for the Extensive game

Formal (O-R) definition:

```{block2,  type='def'}

> Let $\Gamma = \langle N, H, P, (\succsim^i)_{i \in N} \rangle$

(... now defined as a single mathematical object).

Let $z(\sigma)$ represent the 'terminal history generated by some strategy profile $\sigma$' (remember, a strategy profile specifies one complete contingent strategy for each player)...

\

Then:

> A strategy profile $s$ is a Nash equilibrium of game $\Gamma$ if for every player $i \in N$ we have

$$z(s) \succsim^i z(s^{−i}, r^i) \text{ for every strategy } r^i \text{ of player } i$$


I.e., given the other player's strategies ($s^{−i}$) that form part of this profile, the strategy chosen by $i$ is yields an outcome that is at least as good for $i$ as any other outcome.

\

Note $z(s^{−i}, r^i)$ means the profile combining the strategies chosen by each *other* player ($s^{−i}$) with the strategy we are considering for $i$ ($r^i$).

```

\

For example, in the entry game, the profile of strategies $(Out, Fight)$ is (one of two) Nash Equilibria. This holds even though 'Fight' is *not* an optimal action for  for the incumbent in the case we actually *get* to this point (i.e., after the competitor chooses 'In'.).  Against the strategy of 'Out', the strategy "Fight" yields as high a payoff as does her only other strategy ('Cooperate').

\

But perhaps this doesn't seem like a reasonable prediction to make; perhaps not even an important 'stable' equilibrium....

\

"...subgame perfect equilibrium, by contrast, requires that each player’s strategy is optimal, given the other players’ strategies, after *every possible history, whether or not the history occurs if the players follow their strategies.*" (O-R, emphasis added).

\

### Formal: Subgame perfect equilibrium

First we define 'the terminal history extending $h$...' (O-R). This is notationally complicated, but it is fairly simple when you look at some of the examples provided. Basically, this 'terminal history extending h generated by $s$' just specifies the outcome that is reached "if $h$ occurs and then the players choose the actions specified by [their strategies] $s$."


<div class="marginnote">
A slightly simpler definition, used in some texts, refers to 'continuation strategies'.
</div>

Formally:


```{block2,  type='def'}

> The *terminal history extending h generated by $s$*, denoted $z(h,s)$, is $(h, a_1,..., a_T)$

> where $a_1 =s^{P(h)}(h)$ and $a_{t+1} = s^{P(h, a_1,...,a_t)}(h,a_1,...,a_t)$ for $t = 1,...,T−1$.

```

\

And finally, the formal definition of the Subgame perfect [Nash] equilibrium (SPNE); essentially requiring that a strategy prescribes actions that are optimal *after every history*.


```{block2,  type='def'}

...

> A strategy profile ... is a *subgame perfect equilibrium* of $\Gamma$ if for every player ...  and every nonterminal history $h$ for which $P(h) = i$ we have


$$z(h,s) \succsim^i z(h,(s^{−i}, r^i)) \text{ for every strategy } r^i \text{of player} i$$

... (with definitions as above)

```

<div class="marginnote">
As O-R note, "every subgame perfect equilibrium is a Nash equilibrium, but some Nash equilibria are not subgame perfect equilibria."

Subgame perfection is referred to as a 'refinement' of the Nash equilibrium; an additional requirement that allows us to 'rule out' some strategy profiles as unreasonable by this criterion.
</div>



#### Ultimatum game (O-R example 16.1) {-}

This is a widely-considered game, often taken to model bargaining between two people, as we see in the later discussion of the TIOLI bargaining game.

*Some notes:*

```{block2,  type='fold'}

As described, there are *several* Nash equilibria but only two that are subgame perfect... i.e., where player 2 would actually wish to follow-through on her strategy at all points.

\

Here 'indivisible' makes the discussion easier. If we had the good to allocate being expressed as real numbers,the only SPNE would have player 1 offering 0, and player 2 accepting every offer. But this might seem weird because after being offered 0, player 2's decision to choose 'Yes' is only a weak preference.

\

The *situation* of an ultimatum game is tested in economic experiments. However, here fairness preferences may be in play and thus we do not know what the players true preferences are. Thus we are in a sense jointly testing each player's fairness (or other regarding  or social) preferences as well as her strategic decision making.

```


\

#### Centipede game {-}

Maybe it's good to think of as 'alternating buying rounds of drinks at a pub' ... or 'exchanging birthday presents year after year', or 'babysitting for each other'... but where some additional value is gained each time by one guy in excess of the cost to the other guy. E.g., in the drinks case, you are saving the cost of waiting in a queue. As for gifts, this is a hotly debated point: do gifts add net value than their cost?\*

<div class="marginnote">
\*See, e.g., . [@listDeadweightLossChristmas1998; @Reinstein2014; @waldfogelDeadweightLossChristmas1993]

<!-- Add link to gift discussion here -->

\


```{r  fig.cap = '6-period Centipede game, from O-R', out.width='50%', fig.asp=.4, fig.align='center',  echo = FALSE}

knitr::include_graphics("picsfigs/or-6-per-centipede.png")

```


Players: 1, 2

- They alternate making decision to 'stop the game ($S$) or continue ($C$)'

- The game lasts at most $2T$ periods... if no one stops it

- After every period whenever a player choose to continue (C ), she loses $1 and the other player gains $2.


There are many Nash equilibria, but all have the outcome $S0$: player 1 stops immediately. However, the 'complete contingent strategies'  differ among these NE.

> player 1 chooses $S$ at the start of the game and player 2 chooses $S$ after the history $(C)$, but after longer histories each player’s strategy may choose either $C$ or $S$.


> ... given that player 1 intends to stop the game immediately, player 2 is indifferent between all her strategies.


> However, the game has a unique subgame perfect equilibrium, in which each player chooses S whenever she moves.


<div class="marginnote">
I need to think about this more, not sure I get the point they are making here.
</div>

This can be found through backwards induction. In the following subsection O-R make a big deal about how the fully contingent 'strategies', which are more elaborate than 'plans of action'  are meaningful because


>  a pair of strategies in the centipede game, and in other extensive games in which players move more than once, is more than a pair of plans of action; it embodies also an analysis of the game that contains the beliefs of the players about what would happen after any history.

\

```{block2,  type='note'}

This game (see discussion of experimental evidence) also illustrates the idea that being able to solve for the SPNE doesn't necessarily help me play better. Even leaving aside social/fairness preferences here, if you think that the other player will *not* use backwards induction, you might be better off choosing 'continue', at least in the earlier stages.

Another thing to think about: suppose we have a long Centipede game. Suppose I move second, and I've observed the first player choosing 'Continue'. Is it *then* still  reasonable to assume the other player uses backwards induction and maximizes her payoff, or should I adjust my assumptions and my calculations?

```

\





```{block2,  type='note'}

I think you may want to skip, for now, the formal definition of backward induction and the proof of its equivalence to SPE. This seems rather too abstract: I don't see the relevance of this for game theory applications.

```


### Bargaining

Here O-R present and discuss some of the key models in the field of Bargaining theory.  This is well-worth a read, and very relevant to 'applied theoretical questions' (is that an oxymoron?).

It is striking to see how the outcome consistent with SPNE of wach of the setups varies dramatically depending on what seem like small changes in the setup.

#### Take it or leave it (ultimatum game) {-}

#### Finite horizon with alternating offers {-}

#### Infinite horizon with one-sided offers {-}

#### Infinite horizon with one-sided offers and discounting {-}


\

Key idea behind the proof of O-R Prop 16.7:

```{block2,  type='fold'}

"M" is the supremum (think 'maximum' for now) of player 2's payoffs can get in any SPNE.

- This means that if player 1 offers $\beta \times M + \epsilon$  (where $\beta$ is the discounting, e is a 'very small number) in any period, then player 2 will accept the offer...
    - because the most she will get if she waits is to get (less than) M next period, which is worth (less than) $\beta \times M$ to her now, because of discounting


So in any SPNE player 2 plays 'accept' after any history where she has been offered any amount greater than $\beta \times M$
	So player 2's payoffs cannot be strictly greater than $\beta \times M$ in any SPNE



But if she cannot get more than $\beta \times M$ in any SPNE that means that this "$\beta \times M$" is the most she can get, so player 1 only needs to offer $\beta \times beta \times M$...	But then she can not get more than $\beta \times beta \times M$, so player 1 only needs to offer $\beta \times beta \times beta \times M$... etc


More formally, ., the 'supremum' of her payoffs must be $\beta \times M$, but this 'supremum' is defined as M. So $\beta \times M=M$ must hold. It can only hold if $M=0$.


Intuition -- in period $t$ you only need to offer her $\beta \times$ 'the most she could get if she rejects' in period t+1; but if she rejects, then the remaining game (in period $t+1$) is identical to the game now (in period t), so you need to offer her some amount so that 'the discounted value of the amount is the same as the amount itself'... this is only the case if the amount is 0

\

We previously considered games were played was essentially simultaneous or entirely sequential. The important issue was whether or not a player knew the other players choice when making her choice (and potentially being able to revise for choice in light of this; see 'subgame perfection').

We assumed each player knew whom she would potentially be playing with, what her own payoffs were, and what the other players' payoffs were.

\

We will now relax some of these assumptions to consider a wider class of interesting and relevant games. The notes below are less formal to allow us to get a taste of this material and the insights.


\

**We will allow for:**

**1. (Asymmetric) "incomplete information" or (nature/chance); uncertainty about STATES:** One or more players may not know for sure what the payoffs of other players are,\* or (more or less equivalently) "who" the player she is facing is. However this is not blind "I do not know anything" uncertainty.\*\*

<div class="marginnote">
\* Or even she may be unaware of her own payoffs; There are even situations in which other players might know more about player's payoff than the player herself (see for example models, in a slightly different context of "informed principals").

\** The latter is  sometimes called 'ambiguity' or 'Knightian uncertainty'.
</div>

Players know the probability of each type of payoffs, i., the distribution that the payoffs (or player types) are drawn from. This is often modeled in an extensive form or three form by having an initial player called "nature" who simply makes a random choice.

If we assume this is simple symmetric randomness, where all players are equally informed at all points in time, this can basically be encapsulated in our previous frameworks; simply replacing payoffs with expected payoffs.

Instead, we focus on cases where, at a certain point in time, one player knows more than the other player about the random realisation.

\

**2. 'Imperfect' information about (some) previous moves (actions); uncertainty about ACTIONS**

We have seen sequential games where players know all previous moves, i.e. they know "where in the game tree" they are when they make their choices. This was our standard extensive game. We have also seen that simultaneous games are equivalent to sequential games were no player is aware of the choices other players have made when they make their own choices.

Below, we will consider the case where some previous choices may be known while others are not.

\

We can depict "what a player knows when she made her choice" with the use of "information sets" also related to "information partitions", described in the next subsection. In the tree diagrams these are usually depicted by connecting decision nodes (points where a player 'has the move') to one another with solid or dashed lines.

We may also consider 'uncertainty about *states*' with information partitions, if we use the aforementioned notation with the "nature" player.

## Information sets (and 'partitions')


An **information set** for a player is a collection of decision nodes
satisfying:\*

<div class="marginnote">
\*"An information partition is an allocation of each non-terminal node of the tree to an information set."
</div>


i. The player has the move at every node in an information set


ii. When the play of the game reaches a node in the information set, the
player with the move does not know what node within the information set has (or
has not) been reached


- The Player can not distinguish between nodes connected by an information set ...  because he/she doesn't know what decisions were taken previously (by
another player or by "nature")

- A player can't play a different strategy for different nodes connected by an information set

### Examples in tree form

**Example: 'Rocks/Paper/Scissor' in extensive form, with variations.**

**Traditional RPS:**

<center>
![](picsfigs/rps_standard.png)

</center>

*Intuition*: what are the NE?

This is a simultaneous 'strictly competitive' game.  This is an
'anti-coordination' game.

There can be no pure strategy NE.

If player 1 puts $\frac{1}{3}$ probability on each player 2 is neutral
between each action.. If player 2 puts $\frac{1}{3}$ probability on
each (of R, P, S) player 1 is neutral between each action.  Thus this is
a NE, although there may other NE as well (I don't think there are, but
it is worth checking), using the techniques for simultaneous games we
learned previously.

\


**RPS where player 1 is very slow at making a fist:**

<center>

![](picsfigs/rps_slow_fist.png)

</center>




*Intuition*: What will occur?

If player 1 plays rock 2 will play paper and win, yielding payoffs of
0,1.

So player 1 probably won't want to play rock.

But what will player 1 want to play? Paper or scissors?

If player 1 plays scissors or paper player 2 will not know which is
played, and might play scissors ('if not rock'), so as to either win or
tie (but never lose).

But knowing this, player 1 might play scissors -- but then 2 would want
to play rock, which would mean 1 would want to play paper, which would
mean 2 would want to play scissors, which would mean 1 would want to
play scissors \... etc.

There would seem to be no pure strategy prediction here.

But there may be a mixed strategy NE in this '*subgame'.*


## Bayesian games (incomplete information, informal) {#bayes-games}

There is something uncertain, chosen by 'nature or chance' that affect the payoffs of one or more players (resulting from certain combinations of actions); typically we refer to this in terms of "types of players" where each type has a different set of payoffs that results from a certain profile of actions.

There are "common prior beliefs about types": All players know the payoffs of each type and the probability of each type occurring. Furthermore, we typically assume all players know that all players know this, etc. (common knowledge).

However, one (or more) may know *for certain* which type she (or another player) is while other players may only know what the prior probabilities of this were.

E.g., perhaps we both know that there is a 25% chance that the player you will fight against will be *strong* (perhaps we can think of 1/4 of the 'general population'). However, I know for certain whether I am strong or weak, while you do not know this, at the time you make your choice.\*\*

<div class="marginnote">
\*\* I am strong, by the way, not physically, but emotionally.

### Bayesian Nash equilibrium (BNE; informal definition)

> A BNE is a set of strategies, one for each **type of** player such that **no type has an incentive to change his or her strategies given the beliefs about the types and what other types are doing.**

[See this 'sourced' video for a simple description, definition and numerical examples](https://youtu.be/AzN-eV_Na10)

E.g., fighting an opponent of unknown strength; Cournot competition between firms with unknown cost functions.

### Example: Asymmetric information Cournot

<div class="marginnote">

This is a good example to start with but actually it is somewhat less interesting than other examples. This is because the payoffs for the 'player with known costs' actually don't *directly* depend on the type of 'unknown cost player' player you are facing. They only depend on the strategy (here quantity) chosen by this player. So it simply becomes a sort of "average across the best responses to the quantity provided by each type you might be facing".

A game like the *yield-fight* game (or equivalently, a simultaneous entry game) may be more interesting in this regard.
</div>


"Sourced" videos (unfold)

```{block2,  type='fold'}

The video [HERE](https://youtu.be/HicUuUXAI00) presents a version of this game plugging in some specific numbers for certain parameters such as the probability of each type and the proportional cost for the low vs high type (1/2 in each case).

Sometimes playing your numbers make it easier to see the problem behind the notation and certainly easier to solve. However the limitation is that if you plug in specific numbers you can't then look at "comparative statics" you cannot see how the results change as we *adjust* these parameters.


The video is correct but it is very slow (watch at 1.5 speed at least) and takes too many steps.  He would be better off if he simply focused on the marginal revenue equals marginal cost condition and wouldn't have  to solve the problem for the low and high type separately.
```

**Motivation**:

Two firms choose quantities at the same time.  One firm does not know whether the other firm is high or low cost, both know their own costs.  Demand is linear, marginal costs are constant.


\


*Q: How would you model this?*

\

$$
\begin{aligned}
P(Q) =a-Q=a-q_{1}-q_{2} \\
c_{1}(q_{1}) =cq_{1} \\
c_{2}(q_{2}) =c_{2}\cdot q_{2} \\
\text{Where} \text{: } \\
c_{2} =C_{H}\text{ with probability }\theta \\
c_{2} =C_{L}\text{ with probability }1-\theta
\end{aligned}
$$



**Players:** Firms 1 and 2\*

<div class="marginnote">
\* Alternatively, we can model this letting 'Nature' randomly choose 2's type, if we want to use the extensive form/game tree).
</div>

\

**Actions: **Choose a quantity ($q_{1}$ and $q_{2}$)


Actions by types: $1$ chooses $q_{1}$

Player $2$, type $c_{H}$ chooses $q_{2}(c_{H})$

Player $2$, type $c_{L}$ chooses $q_{2}(c_{L})$

\

**Payoffs:**

$$\pi _{k}=q_{k}\cdot p(Q)=q_{k}\cdot (a-q_{1}-q_{2}-c_{k})\text{ for }k\in
\{1,2\}$$

\

**States:** Firm 2's marginal cost $c_{2}\in \{C_{H,}C_{L}\}$ where $C_{L}<C_{H}$

\

**Information structure**

$2$ knows $c_{2}$

$1$ has 'beliefs' that assign $P(c_{2}=C_{H})=\theta$, $P(c_{2}=C_{L})=1-\theta$

*Note*: In these games, beliefs always correspond to the correct (correctly computed) probabilities given the information at hand.

Looking ahead...

```{block2,  type='fold'}

In sequential games, as information is revealed, we will need to consider 'correct Bayesian updating', and we will look For "equilibrium assessments" combining strategies and beliefs at each node for each player...

where these beliefs at every point are consistent with the strategies chosen by each player (type of player) at each decision node.
```


**Best Responses**

Note: These will yield a NE strategy profile, a BNE outcome where these
intersect,

Firm 2:

$q_{2}^{\ast }(c_{t})$ solves $$\begin{aligned}
\max_{q_{2}}\text{ }[(a-q_{1}^{\ast }-q_{2})-C_{t}]q_{2}\text{ for }t \in
\{H,L\} \\
s.t.\text{ }q_{2} >0\end{aligned}$$


```{block2,  type='inputq'}

Q: Explain intuitively what firm 1 will do as a 'best response' \...

```


```{block2,  type='fold'}

A: Firm 1 will set quantity to optimize its expected profit, knowing
that there is some probability it will face a high-cost competitor, and
some probability it will face a low cost competitor. The optimal
quantity will be somewhere in between, in this case, in fact the
weighted average of the optimal quantities in each case.
```


Firm 1:

$q_{1}^{\ast }$ solves $$\begin{aligned}
\max_{q_{1}}\text{ }\left\{
\begin{array}{c}
\theta \lbrack a-q_{1}-q_{2}^{\ast }(C_{H})-c]q_{1}\text{ } \\
+(1-\theta )[a-q_{1}-q_{2}^{\ast }(C_{L})-c]q_{1}%
\end{array}%
\right\}  \\
s.t.q_{1} >0\end{aligned}$$

*Q: How to solve these for BR's?*

*A: Solve for first order-conditions (set first derivative equal to
zero).  This is a necessary condition for an interior optimum, though
not sufficient. We want the 'choice variable' on the left hand side
only, as a function of the parameters and the other firm's choice.*

FOC's:

$$q_{2}^{\ast }(C_{t})=\frac{a-q_{1}^{\ast }-C_{t}}{2}\text{ for }t=L,H
\tag{1 \ 2}$$

$$q_{1}^{\ast }=\frac{\theta \lbrack a-q_{2}^{\ast }(C_{H})-c]+(1-\theta
)[a-q_{2}^{\ast }(C_{L})-c]}{2}  \tag{3}$$

**Note***: *This assumes the parameters are such that both quantities
are positive.  Actually, we *do* have to worry about 'corner solutions'
here -- the high cost firm may not produce -- but we ignore this for
now.

*Q: How to solve these for BNE quantities?*

*A: We need to solve this system of equations, substituting one
player-type's optimum into the others to find a 'fixed point.'*

*Q: What will these BNE quantities be a function of?*

*A:They will be a function of the parameters (*$\theta ,c,C_{H},C_{L}$
*).  They will \*not\* be a function of the other player-type's
quantities!*

We solve this by substituting equation 3 ($q_{1}^{\ast }$) into
equations 1 & 2, and then substituting each of these
($q_{2}^{\ast }(C_{L})$ and $%
q_{2}^{\ast }(C_{H})$) into equation 3.  

This yields: $$\begin{aligned}
q_{2}^{\ast }(C_{H}) =\frac{a-2C_{H}+C}{3}+\frac{1-\theta }{6}(C_{H}-C_{L})
\\
q_{2}^{\ast }(C_{L}) =\frac{a-2C_{L}+C}{3}-\frac{\theta }{6}(C_{H}-C_{L})\end{aligned}$$

\

*Question: What is interesting about these BNE outcomes (outputs)?*

-   The output for the high-cost type is *higher* than the high-cost
    type's output in the complete information case (i.e., in the case   where player 1 knew 2's cost). Remember, this complete informationoutput was $q_{i}^{\ast }=\frac{a-2c_{i}+c_{j}}{3}$ where $c_{i}$
    was own and $c_{j}$ was the other firm's cost.

-   Similarly, the output for the low-cost type is *lower* than the
    low-cost type's output in the complete information case.

-   For both types the BNE output involves not only the cost of the player's type, but the cost of the player's other type!  Note that this was *not* true for the BR functions!

\


*Why?*

A: Your optimal output depends not only on your own costs but on your
expectation of the other player's output, and thus on how the other
player will react to what it *thinks* are your costs!  

Firm $2$ will produce less when its costs are high than when they are
low, ceterus paribus.  However, if firm 1 is not sure firm 2's costs are
high, firm $1$ doesn't know how much firm 2 will limit its output and
thus 1 will not increase its output as much as it would if it *knew*
firm 2's costs were high.  Firm 2 knows this, and thus does not limit
its output as much.  This second effect -- the response to firm $1$'s
lack of information, is described by the second additive terms in the
above\...

\

```{block2,  type='note'}

We see this insight even more dramatically in the [fight/yield game depicted here](https://web.sgh.waw.pl/~mlewan1/Site/GT_files/ps2solution.pdf). In this case, there can be an equilibrium where the 'weak' player chooses 'fight', even though it could never be an equilibrium for her to do so in a game with complete and perfect information.

```
\



*Q: What did we forget to compute?*

Firm 1's BNE strategy (action):
$$q_{1}^{\ast }=\frac{a-2c+\theta C_{H}+(1-\theta )C_{L}}{3}$$

Note, this is like a response based on 'average' $c_{2}$, i.e., $\theta
C_{H}+(1-\theta )C_{L}$. This is a special case: equivalence does not always hold!

### Example: 'fight or yield'/simultaneous entry

In the above example only a *single* player's payoffs (to particular combinations of actions) depended on the uncertainty (i.e., on the type of this same player, Firm 2). Thus we simply needed to

- figure out what 'the best response of each type of Firm 2 was'

- figure out what Firm 1's best response was to 'the response of the average of Firm 2's responses'

... and find an intersection.

\

However, we could let both players payoffs depend on this uncertainty, say, on "one player's type'. This brings an additional (interesting) strategic concern.

Consider a game where both players A and B can choose 'Fight' (Enter) or 'Yield' (Don't Enter). Player B may be of the Weak or Strong type. Only B knows her own type but both know the specific probability, say $\alpha$, that A's will be weak and some probability A's are strong.\*

<div class="marginnote">
This could be likened to a game where firms may enter a market and if both enter only the stronger firm will survive.
</div>

- Suppose that when both yield the payoffs are zero for both.

- When A fights and B yields (or vice versa) the fighter gets $2$ and the yielder gets zero.

- When both fight then the 'winner' depends on whether B is strong.
    - If B is strong then she wins and gains $1$, while A gets $-1$
    - If B is weak then she loses and gets $-1$, while A gets $1$

(Note that I assumed that there is some value lost in the fighting.)

\

*If my payoff to a particular action profile depends on your type,* then if a particular action (say 'Fight') is more likely to come from your 'strong type' than your 'weak type', I need to take that into consideration in my response!  And remember, this is still a *simultaneous* game.

<div class="marginnote">

In general we speak of similar concepts like the 'acceptance curse' in dating:

> Chade (2006) explored a search
and matching environment where participants observe noisy signals of their partners’ types. He notes an “acceptance curse” resembling the winner’s curse from auction theory: a partner’s acceptance decision reveals information about their type.

- [@gallLosingFace2020]

... implying that 'the person who accepts your offer' is an average of 'a worse type' than the average person. (Sorry, this sounds harsh).

</div>


If B only fights when she is strong and not when she is weak (i.e., if only strong B-types fight)

- 'A playing against someone who fights means his playing against someone who is strong' and

- 'A playing against someone who does not fight means his playing against someone who is weak'.

So for A, playing fight means:
- $\alpha$ share of the time facing a strong opponent, who fights (and thus losing, getting -1), and
- $1-\alpha$ share of the time facing a weak opponent, who Yields  (and thus gaining +2)


\

On the other hand if B 'always fights' (whether strong or weak), then for A, playing fight means:

- $\alpha$ share of the time facing a strong opponent, who fights (and thus losing, getting -1 payoff),

- $1-\alpha$ share of the time facing a weak opponent (and thus winning, getting +1 payoff)

\

An example of this game, with slightly different payoffs, deriving the equilibrium under two possible cases is given in [these notes](https://web.sgh.waw.pl/~mlewan1/Site/GT_files/ps2solution.pdf)


## Sequential Games with Imperfect information

<div class="marginnote">
Some notes [here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/1o4rr6chbxnlast/05_BWI_SPNEd_cut_HO_wanskey.pdf?dl=0); some notation comes from a different Osborne text, as well as a text by Watson
</div>

#### Motivating Example - 'Multi-stage-game' {-#multi-stage}

Consider the 'Multi-stage-game' depicted in the tree below.\*

<div class="marginnote">

\* Remember, the dashed lines indicate that player 2, if she has the move, does not know whether 1 chose C or chose D.
</div>

Think it through ... what might we expect will happen? Does it make sense to think that 1 will choose E?

Or is a profile of strategies like $\{C,J;F\}$ reasonable?

```{block2,  type='fold'}

Intuition:

Action-wise, 1 can end the game early by choosing $E$ and get a 'safe' payoff of 2. Or, she can choose D or C, which, as we see, can earn her a maximum payoff of 3, but a minimum payoff of 0.

If she chooses D or C, player 2 'has the move' but 2 will not know whether D or C was chosen; 2 only will know that E was *not* chosen.

If 1 chose D then 2's choice takes us to the terminal node; if 2 believes D was chosen she would prefer to choose F, leaving a payoff of only 1 to each player.

On the other hand, if 1 chose C, then if 2 chooses G the game ends and 1 gets 0 and 2 gets 1.

If, after C, 2 chooses F then 1 has the move once again. At this point 1 would prefer to choose J, earning 3 and leaving 0 for player 2.

So if 2 'gets the move' we might think he will choose $G$ if he thinks $C$ was more likely chosen and she will choose $F$ if he thinks $D$ was more likely chosen. If 1 thinks that he can 'fool' 2 into thinking she chose D (and thus choosing F), she may want to choose C (and then J after F), to earn 3.

But should we predict that 2 is thus 'fooled'? Would this be a reasonable 'fool me once equilibrium'? We return to this [below](#multi-wse).

```



<center>
![Multi-stage-game](picsfigs/tree_consider_beliefs.png)
</center>


Above, suppose that player 1 plays the strategy highlighted in blue (player 2's potential moves are in red). Given player 1's strategy what should 2 suppose if he 'gets the move' (i.e., arrives at information set $\{C,D\}?

Let's say (we are just *considering this*), that 2 supposes that "if 1 were to  decide to deviate from his strategy (E,J) then 1 would play C with probability $\frac{2}{3}$ and D with probability $\frac{1}{3}$."

-   I.e., suppose 2's *beliefs* at this information set assigned the probabilities $\frac{2}{3}$ and $\frac{1}{3}$ to C and D, respectively, as shown in brackets.

We assume that 2 will believe that, even after making this 'mistake' or 'deviation' 1 will subsequently play rationally, i.e., play J if she gets to the node following C,F. Indeed, the proposed strategy $(E,J)$ is consistent with this.

In fact, we will define the concept of [*sequential rationality*](#wse) to capture this; and  n any strategy for player 1 that is 'sequentially rational' she must play $J$ following the history $\(C,F\)$,\*\*

<div class="marginnote">
\*\* We say 'sequentially rational' rather than 'subgame perfect' to also encompass decision nodes like the one faced by 2 when he has the move. Technically, these do not represent the initial node in a 'subgame' as the information set is not a 'singleton' ... i.e., 2 doesn't know 'where he is'.
</div>

- and thus 2 must believe 1 will play $J$ at this node in any WSE, for 'Consistency of Beliefs with Strategies.'


\

*Given the assumptions above, and given 2's beliefs (which we  arbitrarily supposed) **what is 2's 'best' (sequentially rational) action at the information set $\{C,D\}$?**

Let's consider the Expected Utility payoffs to each move:

-   If 1 played C, 2's best move is G, yielding payoff 1. If 1 played D, G yields 0.

-   If 1 played D, 2's best move is F, yielding payoff 1. If 1 played C, F yields 0.

-   $\rightarrow$ So 'which action is better' depends on the probability 1 played C versus D

-   We are supposing that (2 believes that), 'off the equilibrium path', C occurred with probability $\frac{2}{3}$ and D with probability $\frac{1}{3}$

$\rightarrow$ Thus 2's EU payoffs to playing G are:

$$
\begin{aligned}
EU_{2}(G) &=&\Pr (C)\times U_{2}(\{C;G\})+\Pr (D)\times U_{2}(\{D;G\}) \\
&=&\frac{2}{3}\times 1+\frac{1}{3}\times 0=\frac{2}{3}
\end{aligned}
$$

\

On the other hand, 2's EU payoffs to playing F are:

$$
\begin{aligned}
EU_{2}(F) &=&\Pr (C)\times U_{2}(\{C;F\})+\Pr (D)\times U_{2}(\{D;F\}) \\
&=&\frac{2}{3}\times 0+\frac{1}{3}\times 1=\frac{1}{3}
\end{aligned}
$$

So, given the assumptions above, given 2's beliefs and 1's optimal
strategy (for the rest of the game), if 2 is at the information set
\${C,D\}$, his best move is $G$. $G$ is thus the 'sequentially rational' action
*given these beliefs and given 1's strategy.*

\


> Hold on, you! If 1 is choosing $E$ anyway, why do we need to worry about
this?

Well, we are only *considering* that 1 may play E.

1 must ask *'is playing E the best?'* '*Will playing C or D do better
(in EU terms)?'*

To get the answer to this question, 1 needs to ask '*if I play C (or D),
what will player 2 do?*'

But what player 2 does at $\{C,D\}$ will depend on what player 2 *believes*
1 played -- $C$ or $D$.

So, in order to decide the EU payoffs to playing $C$ (or $D$), to
compare this to playing $E$, 1 needs to know (or assign) what player 2's
*beliefs* are at $\{C,D\}$.

<div class="marginnote">

Remember that '1 choosing (E,J)' is a complete strategy, but this tells us nothing about what 2 is supposed to believe if he "gets the move"!

</div>



#### Motivating example: Sequential Rationality {-#mot-seq-rat}

<div class="marginnote">

I present this example to intuitively justify the reasonableness of the 'Sequential Rationality' requirement which will be part of the ['Weak Sequential Equilibrium'](#wse).

</div>


Consider the following example...  *Entry Readiness Game 1* with a Challenger who may be ready or unready and an Incumbent, depicted in the tree below.

<center>
![Entry Readiness Game 1](picsfigs/entry_ready_game.png)

</center>

```{block2,  type='note'}

Note: Technically, there are no proper subgames (remember, a subgame must begin at a singleton information set). So SPNE is in fact the same as NE here.

```

\

**Strategic form:**

<center>
![](picsfigs/entry_ready_strat_2.png)
</center>

<!--
$$\begin{tabular}{ccc}
& \textbf{A} & \textbf{F} \\
\textbf{R} & 3,\underline{3} & 1,1 \\
\textbf{U} & \underline{\textit{4}},\underline{3} & 0,2 \\
\textbf{O} & 2,\underline{4} & \underline{\textit{2,4}}%
\end{tabular}%$$

-->

There are two NE here: $\{Unready;Acquiesce\}$ and $\{Out,Fight\}$.

Are they both reasonable?

Subgame perfection doesn't eliminate either (no proper subgames).

But we know it is suboptimal for the incumbent to fight once the
challenger has entered, whether or not the challenger is prepared. So
'fight' wouldn't seem to be a good strategy ever, and thus \${Out; Fight\}$
depends on an incredible threat.

\

*We could add a requirement:*

```{block2,  type='def'}

**Optimal at each information set (Sequential Rationality):** Each player's strategy is optimal, given her beliefs, whenever she has the move.

```

I.e., each player's strategy must be optimal at each of her information sets.


The strategy 'Fight' is not optimal at each information set here.

```{block2,  type='inputq'}

Why not?

```


\

```{block2,  type='fold'}

A: it is not optimal for the incumbent to play Fight at the incumbent's information set (when he has the move, i.e., after some form of entry). It is not if  he is at the node following *Unready* nor if he is at the node following *Ready*. Thus, no matter his beliefs, this cannot be optimal.

```

Thus, only the NE strategy profile $\{Unready; Acquiesce\}$ meets the (sequential rationality) requirement of optimality at each information set in the game above.

\


### Definitions: Beliefs, sequential equilibrium, assessments

**Remember:** In simultaneous (static) games beliefs about other players' strategies were 'correct' in equilibrium. No player 'regretted' her action.

\

For extensives game this idea is less clearly defined -- some nodes are never reached, so there is no obvious 'correct' belief for nodes that are never
reached in equilibrium !

\

$\rightarrow$  *We will define equilibrium in terms of pairs (assesments): Strategy profiles & collections of beliefs*

\

**Beliefs**

At an information set with more than one history (element/node) the player who has the move 'forms a belief over the histories' (previous moves; including moves by nature).

At each information set a *belief* assigns a probability to each
possible history,

or assigns a probability distribution over all the possible
histories (in an infinite strategy set game)..


\


```{block2,  type='def'}

**Belief System**

A *belief system* is a collection of *beliefs*, one for each information
set of each player.

```
\

```{block2,  type='def'}
**Assessment**

An *assessment* pairs a profile of strategies and a belief system.

```

\

#### Motivating example: Consistency of Beliefs {-}

Consider the following variation of the previous entry game, depicted in the tree below. Call this 'Entry Readiness Game 2'.

<div class="marginnote">

I present this example to intuitively justify the reasonableness of the 'Consistency of beliefs' requirement which will be part of the ['Weak Sequential Equilibrium'](#wse).

</div>

<center>
![Entry Readiness Game 2](picsfigs/entry_ready_game_2.png)

</center>
Strategic form:

![](picsfigs/entry_ready_strat.png)

\

Now the incumbent prefers to fight if the challenger enters unready, but prefers to acquiesce if the challenger enters ready. So there is no clear optimal move at this information set -- it depends whether or not the challenger prepared.

\

*So, is $\{Out; Fight\}$ a reasonable equilibrium profile?*

Perhaps if the incumbent thinks 'any challenger who enters will not prepare.' At this node (following Unready) the action 'Fight' is optimal.

\

Thus the requirement of 'optimality at each information set' does not
rule anything out here.

Note that whether fight is 'optimal' and thus whether the above can be an equilibrium profile depends on the incumbent's *beliefs* about *out-of-equilibrium play*!

\

But are any beliefs reasonable? We have more to say on this...

\


### Equilibrium Concept: Weak sequential equilibrium {#wse}

<div class="marginnote">

WSE is 'almost' the same as Perfect Bayesian Equilibrium, which is more widely referred to. However, PBE imposes additional restrictions on *out of equilibrium* beliefs.

</div>
\

```{block2,  type='def'}

An assessment is a *WSE* if it meets two requirements

*Requirement 1*-- **Sequentially rationality:** Each strategy is
optimal for each player when he has the move given his belief (and the
other players' subsequent prescribed 'continuation' strategies)


*Sequential rationality* rules out off-the-equilibrium-path behavior that is 'suboptimal' (given ones beliefs and given the actions specified by the other players' strategies)

*Requirement 2*  -- **Consistency of Beliefs with Strategies:** Each player's belief is consistent with the strategy profile [See next section](#consistent_blf)..

```

\


### Consistency of Beliefs with Strategies (Requirement 2 of WSE) {#consistent_blf}

> In a steady state, each player's belief must be correct'

- Osborne text


\

**Consistency of beliefs at information sets***:*

At each information set beliefs are determined by Bayes' rule and the
players' equilibrium strategies *'where possible'.*


<!--
However, "off the equilibrium path", e.g., at a surprise event, any updated belief is allowed.
-->




\


**Bayes Rule:** \*

<div class="marginnote">

\* This is a fundamental rule of probability. It is very useful in a wide variety of contexts.  It is worth digging into deeply and understanding it both formally and intuitively, and being able to apply it.

</div>


$$\Pr (X|Y_{1})=\frac{\Pr (X,Y_{1})}{\Pr (Y_{1})}$$

This can be thought of as the 'definition of conditional probability'. But conditional probability also has an intuitive meaning.

\

We can also 'invert the relationship':

$$Pr(Y_{1}|X)=\frac{\Pr (X,Y_{1})}{\Pr (X)}=\frac{\Pr (X|Y_{1})\Pr (Y_{1})}{
\Pr (X)}$$


\



\

If $Y$ is drawn from a discrete set of N possible events $\mathbf{Y=}\{Y_{1},Y_{2},...,Y_{N}\}$ we have:

$$Pr(Y_{1}|X)=\frac{\Pr (X|Y_1)\Pr (Y_{1})}{\Pr (X|Y_{1})\Pr (Y_{1})+\Pr (X|Y_{2})\Pr(Y_{2})+...+\Pr (X|Y_{N})\Pr (Y_{N})}$$
\


For an interesting example,
see the famous ['false positives in a medical test'](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayesian\_analysis\#False\_positives\_in\_a
\_medical\_test)


\

**Bayes rule** for conditional probabilities in the present game theory case:

$$\Pr(h^{\ast}|I_{i}\text{ reached; strategy } \beta)
=\frac{\Pr (h^{\ast };\beta )}{\sum\limits_{h\in I_{i}}\Pr (h;\beta )}$$

<div class="marginnote">
Read this as "the probability of a particular history $h^{\ast}$ having occurred, given that a player finds herself at information set (node) $I_{i}$, given  all players' strategies $\beta$"

Note $Pr(h^{\ast },I_{i})=Pr(h^{\ast })$ here since these only occur together.
</div>



A player finds herself at information set $I_{i}$.  What probability should she assign that $h^{\ast }$ has been played?

By the above formula, she should take the ratio of

- ...the (unconditional) probability that $h^{\ast }$ is played under the
strategy $\beta$

- to the probability we *get* to the information set $I_{i}$.

Note that the latter is the sum of the probabilities of each history that leads us to $I_{i}$... under strategy $\beta$).


*Intuition:* there may be multiple paths (histories( that could have lead to the information set $I_i$. We are simply dividing the *overall* probability of history $h^{\ast}$ (which leads $I_i$) by the sum of the probabilities of *all other histories* that lead to $I_i$.\*

<div class="marginnote">
This is only an interesting calculation if we have a mixed or "behavioral" strategy (similar to a mixed strategy but mixing at a particular information set/node). Otherwise the probability will generally be 1 or will be undefined.

</div>

#### Example: Consistency of beliefs at information sets "on the equilibrium path" {-}


We come back to 'Entry Readiness Game 1':


<center>
![Entry Readiness Game 1](picsfigs/entry_ready_game.png)
</center>


[Above](#mot-seq-rat), we decided that \${Unready,Acquiesce\}$ and \${Out,Fight\}$
are both SPNE, but only $\{Unready,Acquiesce\}$ involves optimal actions at all
information sets ('continuation games').

\

Let's consider the (candidate) equilibrium **\${Unready,Acquiesce\}$**,
which is a *SPNE*, is *optimal at each information set,* and potentially also a *WSE*.

The incumbent's information set \${Ready, Unready\}$ is thus *on* the
equilibrium path.

\

Given the challenger's equilibrium strategy (if this is an equilibrium),

the only belief that is *consistent* with this strategy sets $\Pr (Ready)=0,\Pr(Unready)=1$.

\...And given this belief, the incumbent is playing the sequentially
rational strategy 'acquiesce.'


\

#### Example II : Consistency of beliefs at information sets "on the equilibrium path" {-#multi-wse}

We return to the 'Multi-stage-game' depicted [above](#multi-stage):


<center>

![Multi-stage-game](picsfigs/multi-game.png)

</center>


1. Let's examine the pairing of beliefs and strategies graphically depicted
above.

- Player 1's strategy (E,J) is depicted in blue.

- Player 2's strategy is (G), depicted in red.

We already noted (see above discussion) that each of these strategies are sequentially rational (requirement 1).


\

Now...
```{block2,  type='inputq'}

Do player 2's beliefs meet the consistency requirement (requirement II)?

```

\

Yes, they do trivially, because player 2's information set is off the
equilibrium path, so *any beliefs are permitted.*

So the assessment that pairs the profile of strategies $\{E,J;G\}$ with
player 2's beliefs -- $\Pr (C)=\frac{2}{3}$,$\Pr (D)=\frac{1}{3}$ is a
WSE.

\

**2.** What about the profile $\{D,J;G\}$ (depicted below)-- This is a NE,
and sequentially rational for the previously discussed belief system -- $\Pr(C)=\frac{2}{3}$,$\Pr (D)=\frac{1}{3}$.

<center>

![Multi-stage-game](picsfigs/multi-game-not-wse.png)

</center>

\

But given 1's strategy such a belief system is not consistent, as this 'mixing' does not describe what player 1 does, and this is *on* the equilibrium path!

\


```{block2,  type='inputq'}

Can this be a WSE for *some* consistent belief system?

```


Given 1's strategy (D,J), the *only* consistent belief at information set
$\{C,D\}$ is simply $\Pr (D)=1$.

But if $\Pr (D)=1$,

$$\begin{aligned}
EU_{2}(G) &=&0 \\
EU_{2}(F) &=&1
\end{aligned}$$

So playing G is not sequentially rational.

\

So the WSE rules out the 'fool me once' outcome we discussed at the top.

\

**Note on the above, relating equilibrium concepts**  (unfold)

**Remember**: WSE is a *refinement* of SPNE, which was a refinement of
NE. So, any PBE must be a SPNE and a NE (but not necessarily vice/versa)

Let's examine a *subset* of the strategic form, leaving out strategies
that include the strategy k (which cannot be part of a subgame perfect equilibrium).


![](picsfigs/multi-strat-subset.png)


Since $\{E,J;G\}$ was the only SPNE in pure strategies we already knew
it (paired with appropriate beliefs) was the only WSE in pure strategies.

\

### Sequential games with 'nature' {#seql-nature}

We now consider games where 'chance plays a role'. As in our earlier discussion of ['Bayesian games'](#bayes-games), nature selects a random value which is revealed to (e.g.) only one player.


#### Example: (a very simplified version of) Poker

Nature first chooses whether player 1 has a 'high' or 'low' card (a good or bad hand) relative to the other player. She *knows* this.

She can 'See' ('check') or Raise the bet.

Next, player 2, who *doesn't* know 1's hand, can "Pass" (aka "fold his hand") or "Meet".

Payoffs are given below; note that these depend both on the actions of each player and on the 'choice of Chance'.

<center>

![](picsfigs/poker_tree.png)

</center>

\

We can write this in 'Bayesian Normal (strategic) form', to consider the BNE. Note that this does *not* consider sequential rationality:

Bayesian normal form:\*

<div class="marginnote">
\* Payoffs expressed as EU payoffs (over both types), player 1's strategy depicted for 'Low type, High type' respectively</div>


  --------- -------------------- ---------------------------------------------
                  **Pass**                         **Meet**
   **R,R**   **1**,-1                       0,**0**
   **R,S**   0,**0**                         (1/2),-(1/2)
   **S,R**   **1**,-1                        -(1/2), (1/2)
   **S,S**   0,**0**                        0,**0**
  --------- -------------------- ---------------------------------------------


\

$(S,S)$ is strictly dominated by a mixed strategy:  $\frac{1}{2} \cdot (R,R)  \oplus \frac{1}{2} \cdot (R,S)$

$\mathbf{\Longrightarrow }(S,S)$ is not used as part of any NE

\

  --------- -------------------- --------------------------------------------
                  **Pass**                         **Meet**
   **R,R**   **1**,-1                              0,**0**
   **R,S**   0,**0**                              **(1/2)**,-(1/2)
   **S,R**   **1**,-1                            -(1/2),**(1/2)**
  --------- -------------------- --------------------------------------------

$\rightarrow$ No equilibrium in pure strategies.

\

$\mathbf{\Longrightarrow }\Pr (meet)>0$

$\mathbf{\Longrightarrow }(S,R)$ not a BR:

--If Meet than (R,R) better

--If Pass than (R,R) is just as good

\

$\mathbf{\Longrightarrow }$ So don't put any probability on $(S,R)$; would
do better by moving this to $(R,R)$

$\mathbf{\Longrightarrow }$ Mix between $(R,R)$ and $(R,S)$, which I claim was the intuitive result.

You will always raise if you have the high cards (there is no way to do
better). You will sometimes raise if you have the low cards (i.e.,
'bluff').

BNE strategy profile:

$(\frac{1}{3}\cdot (R,R) \oplus \frac{2}{3} \cdot (R,S); \:  \frac{1}{3} \cdot p \oplus \frac{2}{3} \cdot m)$

Player 1 bluffs with probability $\frac{1}{3}$... and player 2 'always calls bluff' with probability $\frac{2}{3}$.


#### Checking WSE for the above example {-}

Is this a WSE (if paired with consistent beliefs?) Let us check our two requirements; we need only check these for player 2 given player 1's strategy, since for player 1 we need not about beliefs or sequential rationality of his strategy.

*1. Consistency of beliefs:*

The only consistent beliefs at 2's information set is that

*(Recalling Bayes rule...:)*

$Pr(Y_{1}|X)=\frac{\Pr (X,Y_{1})}{\Pr (X)}=\frac{\Pr (X|Y_{1})\Pr (Y_{1})}{ \Pr (X)}=\frac{\Pr (X|Y)\Pr (Y_{1})}{\Pr (X|Y_{1})\Pr (Y_{1})+\Pr (X|Y_{2})\Pr (Y_{2})+...+\Pr (X|Y_{N})\Pr (Y_{N})}$

\

Applying this to the present case:

$Pr(\text{high} |\text{2 has move}) =$

$\frac{pr(raise|high)\ast pr(high)}{ pr(raise|high)\ast pr(high)+pr(raise|low)\ast pr(low)}=\frac{1\ast \frac{1}{2}}{1\ast \frac{1}{2}+\frac{1}{2}\ast \frac{1}{3}}=\frac{3}{4}$

\

*2. Sequential rationality:*

If 2 plays Pass he gets $-1$ (for sure)

If 2 plays Meet he gets $-2\ast \frac{3}{4}+2\ast \frac{1}{4}= -1$

So 2 is indeed neutral between these 2 strategies and thus mixing (in
the proportions determined before) is a best response at this information set.

\

Hence,
$(\frac{1}{3}\cdot (R,R) \oplus \frac{2}{3} \cdot (R,S); \: \frac{1}{3} \cdot   p \oplus \frac{2}{3} \cdot m)$ paired with beliefs $Pr(\text{high} |\text{2 has move}) =\frac{3}{4}$ is a WSE. 
\


### Most famous case: the [@spenceJobMarketSignaling1973] signaling model

**Simple 2x2 signaling game (education and labor market)**

**Players:** Sender, Reciever, Nature

**Actions (and order):**

1. Nature: Good ability, Bad ability (chosen with probabilities $P_{G}$
& $1-P_{G}$)

2. Sender: Signal Good (e.g, School), Signal Bad (e.g., Drink)

3. Reciever: Hire, Not hire

\


**Information structure:**

Sender observes ability

Reciever does not observe ability (Nature's move).

Receiver observes Sender's signal.

\


**Payoffs**

In general

$U_{\text{Sender}}= \text{Salary} - \text{cost of signal (a function of sender's ability)}$

$U_{Reciever}$= 

- If hire: Production (function of sender's ability) - Salary 

- If not hire: 0

\

In general, the production function and wages are such that the reciever will want to hire a good worker and not hire a bad worker.

However, if the receiver doesn't know a sender's (worker's) ability, it would be
more profitable to never hire than to always hire.

The overall structure is given below: 

```{r  fig.cap = 'Signaling game structure', out.width='70%', fig.asp=.4, fig.align='center',  echo = FALSE}

 knitr::include_graphics("picsfigs/send_recieve_no_payoffs.png")

```

```{block2,  type='note'}
For a deep understanding of the signaling game we would want to analyze this game for all possible reasonable combinations of payoffs, and make some general conclusions that depend on the relative parameters. 

For now, we will consider and contrast two numerical examples.
```  

\

#### Signaling: Numerical Example I {-}


Suppose the salary is set (exogenously) at $S=4$.

The payoff to of not being hired is $2$ (second best job).

The production of a bad worker is $3$, so the firm 'nets' -1 from hiring
such a worker.

The productivity of a good worker is $6$, so the firm 'nets' 2 from
hiring such a worker.

The cost of sending a good signal (e.g., going to school or university) is 1 for the good worker and 3 for the bad worker.

Finally, the probability of nature selecting a good worker is 0.1, i.e., 10%.

\

This implies the firm would rather hire a good worker but not hire a bad
worker.  However, the firm would rather hire no one than hiring everyone.

\

If education means the difference between a job or no job, in this case,
only the good worker would choose to go to school (send a 'good'
signal).

However if education will not make a difference (say, you are hired in either case), then neither type would go to school, as it is costly.

This yields the following game tree:

```{r  fig.cap = 'Signaling game example 1', out.width='80%', fig.asp=.7, fig.align='center',  echo = FALSE}

 knitr::include_graphics("picsfigs/signaling_multi_eq.png")

```

<div class="inputqn">
Do you understand this setup? Can you describe the paths that lead to each terminal node?
</div>
 
**Let us check a potential 'separating' equilibrium.**

Suppose the Sender plays (Drink,School) -- i.e., Drink if Bad, get an
education if Good.

Then suppose the reciever plays (Not, Hire) -- i.e., don't hire if
Drink, hire if School.

The only beliefs by a sender in such a situation that are *consistent* with this strategy is to believe Nature picked 'Good' if he receives a Good signal (School), and Nature picked 'Bad' if he receives a Bad signal (Drink).

\

*Given these beliefs and strategies, are these best responses at each
information set?*


Compare Expected utility values:

$$EU_{S}(Drink,School;(Not,Hire))=0.1(4)+0.9(2)=0.2$$

Note this EU is *additive* in the EU of each 'type' (good or bad). Thus for this to be a BR it has to be a BR for *each* type of sender. We also require sequential rationality, which implies a player is acting optimally given his beliefs at each information set.

Note that given the receiver's strategy (hire if and only if
the sender is educated) the decision to get an education is *pivotal*. And as we set it up, only the good type wants to get an education if it is pivotal.
So yes,  each type of sender is behaving optimally (i.e., the sender is
behaving optimally in each contingency)

\

Given the sender's strategy (get education if and only if Good), is the
reciever behaving optimally given her beliefs? Of course she is:

As we set it up, the receiver prefers to hire the Good, and not hire the
Bad. 

So this $\{Drink,School;Not,Hire\}$ is a WSE (sequential rational under
the beliefs mentioned above, which are of course consistent).

But this might not be the *only* WSE for this numerical example -- there may
be others.   For example, pooling on 'no school' -- if the employer will not hire for
either signal -- is a WSE. I.e., $\{Drink,Drink; \: Not,Not\}$ paired with the belief $\big(Pr(Good|Drink)=Pr(Good|School)=0.1\big)$ is a WSE.\*
<div class="marginnote">
\* Exercise: Check this.
</div>

\

#### Signaling: Numerical Example II {-}

Let's change the payoff: 

Suppose the salary is set (exogenously) at $S=5$

The payoff to of not being hired is $0$.

The production of a bad worker is 4, so the firm 'nets' -1 from hiring
such a worker.

The productivity of a good worker is 7, so the firm 'nets' 2 from hiring
such a worker.

The cost of sending a good signal (e.g., going to school) is 1 for the
good worker and 2 for the bad worker.

Finally, the probability of nature selecting a good worker is 0.1.  

This implies (as before) the firm would rather hire a good worker but
not hire a bad worker.

However, (as before) the firm would rather hire no one than hiring
everyone; so if there is pooling, it must be involve hiring no one.

*Notice: (Unlike before )* If education means the difference between a
job or no job (i.e., is 'pivotal'), both types would choose to go to
school (send a 'good' signal).

However (as before) if education will not make a difference (say, you
are hired in either case), then neither type would go to school, as it
is costly.

This yields the following game tree:
```{r  fig.cap = 'Signaling game example 2', out.width='80%', fig.asp=.7, fig.align='center',  echo = FALSE}

 knitr::include_graphics("picsfigs/signaling_no_sep.png")
```
\


Let us check a potential 'separating' equilibrium.

Suppose the sender plays (Drink,School) -- i.e., don't get an education
if bad, get an education if good. Then suppose the Reciever plays (Not, Hire) -- i.e., don't hire if Drink, hire if School.

The only beliefs by a Reciever in such a situation that are *consistent*
with this strategy is to believe Nature picked 'Good' if he receives a
Good signal (education), and Nature picked 'Bad' if he receives a Bad signal (Drink). 

\

*Given these beliefs and strategies, are these best responses at each
information set?*

Note that given the receiver's strategy (hire if and only if educated) the decision to get an education is *pivotal*.  And, as we set it up, each type of sender wants to get an education if it is pivotal. So the sender is not behaving optimally in the contingency where he is Bad (i.e., for this type). The bad type should *also* want to pretend to be a good type and get an education. So this is NOT a WSE!

\

We can look for *pooling* WSE in this case -- there seem to be no
separating WSE (in pure strategies) here.

Note that the firm prefers to hire no one than hire everyone (given the
setup). So, if both types do the same thing, the firm cannot tell which
is which, and will thus hire no one. So for any pooling equilibrium
here, the firm will hire no one. For example, we can look at
{$Drink,Drink; \: Not,Not$ }.

However, here the firm could assign *any* beliefs if it observes a good
signal (education), as such a signal is *off the equilibrium path.*It
gets complicated now. 

One possible belief that the firm might hold is that any player who signals *Good* (gets an education) is a Good worker. But if this were the beliefs, the firm would not be behaving optimally -- it should thus *hire* such a worker!

Another possible belief is that if a worker signals 'Good' it has only a
$.1$ probability of being a Good worker. I.e., the conditional
probability (after observing such off-path play) is the same as the
unconditional probability.This belief will make the strategy profile {$Drink,Drink; \: Not,Not$} sequentially rational. Thus
{$Drink,Drink; \: Not,Not$ } paired with the belief
($Pr(Good|Drink) = Pr(Good|School)=0.1$) is a WSE.

\

We can also look for other possible WSE. We may find a separating (or
pooling) WSE where the receiver plays *behavioral strategies*, hiring
only some proportion of the time when she gets a good signal. In such a
case, the EU benefit to the sender may be such that getting an education
is only pivotal for the Good type. This is too complicated to cover now.

\
Note: further study of signaling games and sequential games with asymmetric information would involve:

```{block2,  type='fold'}

- Restricting the set of beliefs that are reasonable *off the equilibrium path*; this relates to the 'Perfect Bayesian Equilibrium' concept and to the so-called 'Intuitive Criterion'

- Considering a "designer's" choice of a cost of a signaling mechanism; How much should it cost and how can it fruitfully separate types without wasting too many resources?
    
- Considering equilibria involving 'behavioral strategies' as mentioned above. 

```


# Suggested exercises {-#gt_strat_ex}

## Strategic games

Nearly all the exercises are interesting. Some suggestions:

### 1. Centipede game ... {-}

- Note that considering social preferences this is used to consider 'trust and trustworthiness'

- Note that even though this is a sequential game it can be modeled as a strategic game (strategic form)

Hint:

```{block2,  type='fold'}

Let the players’ sets of actions be $A1 = \{1,3,5,...,99,\infty\}$ and $A2 = $\{2,4,6,...,100,\infty\}$, where the action $t$ means stop at period $t$ and the action $\infty$ means "never stop."

```

### 3. War of attrition {-}

### 5. Guessing two-thirds of the average {-}

<div class="marginnote">
I discuss a similar game [here](https://web.microsoftstream.com/video/9f835e1c-bd24-48f1-b9ff-d3ea55bf6721?st=2400) at about 40:00, accessible to BEEM101 students only. I am slightly imprecise here, but I convey the intuition for why this is a unique strategy that survives Iterated Strict Dominance.
</div>


AKA the 'beauty contest'


### 6. "Cheap talk" {-}

Note that 'cheap talk' is a big topic in game theory.

### 8. All pay auction {-}

There has been some literature arguing that such auctions could have certain benefits in fundraising for charity/public goods, at least relative to 'standard charity auctions'.

### 9. Another version of the location game {-}

This relates to Public Choice and Political Science; see the 'Median Voter Theorem'

### 11. Contribution game {-}

Very relevant to public goods, cooperation, and Public Economics

### 15. Hawk or dove {-}

A model from biology (I think) that is applied widely, e.g., to competition between firms


## Extensive games

### OR-1: Trust game {-}

<div class="marginnote">
This setup is used (even more often than Centipede) in the social preferences literature to measure 'trust and trustworthiness'. But note that the payoffs in a game we model should *include* any social preferences (unlike you are asked to do in this problem).

</div>

### OR-4: Comparative statics {-}

### OR-5:  Auctions {-}

### OR-6: Solomon's mechanism {-}

<div class="marginnote">

This relates a bit to the field of 'mechanism design'... we see this procedure didn't require King Solomon to even *know* which player was the 'true owner'... thus this 'works' even under asymmetric information.

</div>

### OR-8: Race {-}

### OR-10: Implementation {-}

<div class="marginnote">
Again, this touches on 'mechanism design'

# Beem101: Project, discussion of research {-#project}


```{block2,  type='note'}

BEEM101 Autumn 2020 students: Please fill out the anonymous survey questions on the [Final project channel on the Teams team](https://teams.microsoft.com/l/channel/19%3a2b075cd7fa57452f8f75266d9088895c%40thread.tacv2/Final%2520project?groupId=68890d91-9fed-46ab-a491-267df512c21a&tenantId=912a5d77-fb98-4eee-af32-1334d8f04a53)

```

\

## Description from ELE page:

60% of mark: "Final project and presentation"

The point of this project and presentation (unfold):

```{block2,  type='fold'}

These are not meant to be dissertations or major pieces of original work. The idea is simply to demonstrate your understanding and ability to apply material from this module, particular the second half of the module. I also want this to be a stepping stone, to help you learn to apply microeconomic theory in your dissertation and career research work.

I am asking you to present this to me because I think that provides a great opportunity for feedback and for you to demonstrate your personal mastery and understanding of this material. Particular in a world without invigilated examination, I want to give you the chance to really show off your strength.

```  

\

Several options (discussed below):  all ask you to 'explain, assess and apply microeconomic theory'.

I will arrange group or individual meetings in Late-November or Early December for you to tell me your proposed topic and group, and for us to discuss this. 

The project must *not* principally involve material covered in the midterm (and obviously please do not copy content from the lecture materials/web book/textbooks): it must involve Game Theory and/or enrichment/supplemental topics (which may include price-discrimination and/or asymmetric information).


- All projects must include and explain some formal economic modeling (with maths), showing your understanding and insight. In other words, you *must* demonstrate your understanding of Microeconomics and your ability to apply it in some way.

- All projects must cite and explain *at least two* peer-reviewed academic Economics articles (and perhaps more).

- Ideally, these projects will relate to your proposed dissertation (if your programme requires you to do one), or to your career goals

\


**Rules and dates (for Autumn 2020 Exeter students)**

To be submitted by `r format_with_col("11 January", "red")`  

- Written length: approximately 8-12 pages, 5000-7000 words; for group projects add 5 additional pages to the maximum per additional member of the group, up to 30 pages for a four member group.

- If it is submitted as a group project each student must also submit a one-page description of the project and their contribution to it

- Spoken presentation (with slides if desired): 8-10 minutes plus 4-5 minutes discussion and feedback (group presentations may take slightly longer)

- Presentations to be scheduled and take place (online on Teams or in person if health conditions permit) by 15 January  (subject to confirmation)

- Alternative: You can instead give a presentation *before* submitting your project; this may help as it will enable you to gain feedback in advance of your submitted project. 

- For group work, each student must present part of the work to me and respond to at least one question 


\

**How to structure the project (a rough sketch, not 'the only way')**

```{block2,  type='fold'}

I was asked about the 'structure' of the project. This depends on the option, on your topic choice, and on how you wish to pursue it. Nonetheless, a rough structure might look like the following:

  \

1.  Introduce the topic, model, question, overview of what you are going to do, and why this is relevant and interesting (some combination of this)

The Economic theory/theories and model(s) presented...

- with reference to academic authors (papers, textbooks)  
- using formal (maths) modeling, giving at least one simple but formal presentation, and explaining it clearly and in your own voice (remember to explain what all variables mean),  
- considering the *assumptions* and simplifications of the model,  
- the 'Economic tool/fields considered' (e.g., optimisation, equilibrium)  - the sensitivity of the 'predictions' to the assumptions  
- the justification for these assumptions  
- and the relationship between this model and your (applied) topic or focus... are the assumptions relevant, what are the 'predictions' etc. 

\

2. The application or real world example:
	
- Explain it in practical terms and what the 'issues and questions are' (possibly engaging the previous literature a bit, but not too much as this project is mainly about the *theory and modeling*),

- describe and express it formally,

- relate it to the model/theory and apply the model theory to your real world example,

-  and try to 'model it' and derive 'results' or predictions, continually justifying the application of the model to the example.
	
\

3. Presenting and assessing the insights from the model for the application and vice/versa
	
- considering the relevance and sensitivity,
- considering which alternative models/assumptions might be used, and how might it be adjusted,
- discussing 'what modeling and theory achieved or did not achieve here'
	
	
Note that "2" could come before or after "3" ... you can present the application first, or the model first... (or there may even be a way to go back and forth between the two, presenting one part of each, as long as this doesn't get confusing).

```

## Option 1: Game Theory: Characterization and analysis of a real-world situation/problem/issue

Consider a real-world situation, problem or issue involving strategic interaction.  Characterize and analyse this using the tools of microeconomics and game theory (or principle-agent models and mechanism design.)  You may get some ideas from the game theory material and [exercises in this web book](#gt_strat_ex) and O-R, but obviously it most go further than this. 

\


One possible (approximate) structure for this project: 

*Introduction* 
1. State and briefly describe the topic. If possible, briefly explain why it is important, relevant, or interesting (for policy, for business and management, or for considering human behavior, or otherwise).

\

*Model the behaviour/outcome*  \*

2. Set up the problem (game theory: players, strategies/actions, payoffs, information structure)

3. List your assumptions

4. solve and interpret the model (game theory: define and explain the 'solution concept' you are using)

<div class="marginnote">
\* Note: you may find it most feasible to construct this by adapting an existing applied model to your particular question. Please reference any work you have adapted, and discuss how you have adapted it.
</div>
 
\

*Discussion*

6. Discuss the 'results' of the model (any insights, anything that the predictions crucially depend on)

7. (If applicable) What policy can lead to better outcomes? (e.g. increasing/decreasing a key variable, or changing incentive structure)

8. What are some limitations of your model? How may they affect your results?

\

Some projects that I somwhat randomly found on the web that are sort-of like what I have in mind (but usually these are whole theses, much more than I'm expecting from you here):

```{block2,  type='fold'}

[Mixed Strategy Equilibrium in Tennis Serves](https://econ.duke.edu/sites/econ.duke.edu/files/file-attachments/Wiles%2C%20Joel%20-%20Honors%20Thesis.pdf) -- This is a whole undergraduate dissertation. Much more than you are expected to do for this assignment. But your assignment could resemble some parts of his literature survey plus some parts of the simple model that he presents before doing the empirical analysis.  (And I like the close connection between theory and empirics here, and the way he shows a strong grasp of the literature!)


\

[In this honors undergraduate thesis](https://web.archive.org/web/20150828040526/http://economics.stanford.edu/files/Theses/CasatrinaLeeHonorsThesis-May2014.pdf) the comparison of the 'Lojack' and 'Cybersecurity model' seems interesting and well-explained, fairly straightforward, and not too mathematically intricate.  
\


[The Price of Anarchy in Network Creation
Games Is (Mostly) Constant](http://www.cs.tau.ac.il/~fiat/cgt12/GameTheoryProject.ItzikMalkiel.pdf) -- I'm not familiar with the content. The maths is  more advanced than I'm expecting (these seem to be maths students), and the description is not as complete as I'd like.  But the length and coverage are sort of in the right direction.

## Option 2: Asymmetric information/agency theory/mechanism design: Characterization and analysis of a real-world situation/problem/issue

(As in option one, but for Principal-agent models/mechanisms (see, e.g., the supplement on [asymmetric information](#asymmetric)); this usually implies a 'contracting' situation.)

\

Models in this category sometimes have overlap with game theory, but...

One of the important distinctions is the assumption that *contracts can be written and enforced.*

\

We often focus on the characteristics of this contract (or pricing scheme, or 'direct mechanism', or screening and signaling institutions etc). 

\

We may consider how it may be set

- to optimise the goals (profit, social welfare etc) of the Principal or 'designer',

- subject to 'incentive compatibility' (and 'participation' or 'rationality') constraints as well as other potential constraints such as 'limited liability'.

\

And we consider how the outcomes of this optimal (or often "2nd best") contract...

- meet social welfare criterion, 

- what the outcomes are (who gets what, what is produced or implemented), and

-  how this is affected by changes in the conditions and parameters ("comparative statics"). 

\

*Asymmetric information* and associated setups may involve:

- Hidden actions $\rightarrow$ (e.g., 'moral hazard')

- Hidden information $\rightarrow$ (e.g., 'adverse selection', 'information rents/privacy')

- Both 

- Incomplete contracting (e.g., involving unknown unknowns), imperfect bargaining, and 'transactions costs'

[Deterring Inefficient Gambling in Risk-Taking
Agents](https://sites.duke.edu/econhonors/files/2015/06/Ryan-Westphal.pdf): the model in section 3 is a much more ambitious version of what I would love to see here. 

\

[Incentive Programs for Neglected Diseases](https://sites.duke.edu/econhonors/files/2020/05/ganapathy2020.pdf) - much more intricate than I'm expecting from you. But the modeling of the payoffs is rather nice and straightforward.

## Option 3: Application of economic theory to (observational) empirical work (econometric/statistical analysis)

Econometricians collect and use data, and seek to 'identify' particular parameters and relationships, often seeking 'causal inference'.

Consider a *particular* empirical question or policy issue (in Economics or an adjacent area). Conduct a brief survey to identify and characterise the work that has been done in this area. (But please do not go into too much detail in writing about this, if it does not relate to microeconomic theory). You may want to focus on a small number of papers.

Explain how microeconomic theory *influences* the statistical/econometric framing and analysis of this question, and the interpretation of the results. What theoretical models (e.g., of consumer and firm choices, government policy goals, strategic interactions, asymmetric information, institutions and market structures) do they use to 'motivate' their question and justify their empirical econometric approach. Specify and explain these models carefully. Consider how these inform the authors empirical analysis. (E.g., the authors may justify their analysis by stating 'this technique identifies the following parameter under the assumptions of the so-and-so model'.)

*See discussion [HERE](https://daaronr.github.io/writing_econ_research/theory-modeling-empirical.html#from-theory-to-empirical-work) on how theory and models can inform applied questions and empirical work


Explain and critique the authors' claims and justifications. If possible, consider the *difference* between the approaches of several authors, contrasting and evaluating their claims and arguments.\*

<div class="marginnote">
\* If you like, you can use this as an opportunity to propose and present your *own actual* analysis of data, but this is not necessary; the focus should be on the theoretical modeling and assumptions, not the empirical analysis.)
</div>
 
## Option 4: Comparison of 'Economic experiment' designs (lab or field experiments) guided by Microeconomic theory

Please consider a question or issue in microeconomics that may be addressed through the use of an experiment, whether a laboratory or field experiment. Find several papers that attempt to do this. Explain how their designs reflect economic theory and assumptions, presenting and explaining the relevant economic theory and models. Comparing these papers, discuss the relative strengths and weaknesses of their designs in providing evidence on the question of interest. If you like, you may propose and make a case for an alternative experimental design or approach.

[This undergraduate thesis](https://web.archive.org/web/20150828040623/http://economics.stanford.edu/files/RobertCortesHonorsThesis-June2013.pdf) does a great job of:
  
1.. Explaining the Allais paradox and the alternatives to EU theory that may explain such behavior
2. Discussing the prior evidence on this
3 Proposing (and running) an experiment measuring how whether decisions in pairs are less likely to make choices in line with this paradox 
  
The student engages and discusses the theory very well. Again, I'm not asking you to write a thesis but if you can do any of the above three components in a reasonable way (for your chosen question), that would be great.

## Option 5: Explanation of another 'advanced concept' in Microeconomic theory (not covered in midterm), application to a real-world situation/problem/issue (or a deep theoretical question involving human values and behavior)

In the notes and readings I mention 'enrichment' and 'advanced' concepts. If you choose this option, your project should explore one of these concepts further. For the concept you choose, please present the formal models clearly and explain these 'in your own words'. Discuss the insights these models provide. Discuss the differing approaches and 'controversies' surrounding these models. Provide and explain an example of how this concept applies (and perhaps 'how it has been applied by researchers') to either a  real-world situation/problem/issue, or to a 'deep question informing our understanding of human values and behavior, and aggregate social and market outcomes'.


```{block2,  type='hint'}

One model for writing this: try to emulate one of the more in-depth Wikipedia articles. (But don't choose a concept that already *has* a good Wikipedia article)

```  

## Option 6: Real-world pricing and segmentation (or other forms of price discrimination) behavior asessed in light of economic theory

Consider the pricing policies of a particular firm, industry, sector, or 'pricing guru'. Explain how these policies do or do not resemble the predictions of economic theory. You may want to focus on particular types of 'segmentation' or 'price discrimination.'

## Other options:  You can propose another project that doesn't exactly fit into the categories above. BUT ...

If you do so, please do so by early November, and obtain my tentative approval. I want to make sure that all projects achieve the goals of demonstrating your understanding and ability to apply Microeconomics. So be careful.

## Neoclassical versus Behavioural economics (simple discussion)


*(Neo)classical economics assumes:*

- Firms maximise profit

- Individuals/households have a consistent utility function which they act 'rationally' to maximise

Furthermore, it is mainly focused on *own* consumption,  ignores 'cognitive costs', ignores 'malleable and changing preferences'


```{block2,  type='note'}
We can not say someones *preferences* are irrational, only that either \
they are not acting optimally to maximize their welfare *given* these preferences or \
their preferences are not internally consistent (e.g., not-transitive), are not fully self-interested (altruism), \
 or are otherwise difficult to model (e.g., depending on the *manner* they make choices and not only the outcomes.
```

\

Classical economics assumes

- Optimization of a consistent ‘normal’ utility function subject to  known constraints
    - Only own consumption matters?
    - No cost to gather information or make calculations?

\

(Perhaps) expected utility preferences over gambles/investments, and probabilities ar  accurately known.

\

Geometric discounting of future payoffs with a single  discount rate ... or at least a 'consistent' discount rate.

What do I mean by 'consistent' discount rate"...

```{block2,  type='fold'}

The discount rate between two periods or two calendar years *is* allowed to vary in the classical model.

However, it must be consistent in the following sense: the discount rate must depend on *which periods the consumption is being traded off between.*

It should *not* depend on which period I am in when I am making the decision. More on this under 'hyperbolic discounting', time-inconsistency, and impatience, below.

```

E.g., if $\delta=0.1$ in each period then next period's payoff of 100 is worth as much as $(1-0.1) \times 100 = 90$  today. \

A payoff of 100 in two periods is worth as much as $(1-0.1) \times 100 = 90$ tomorrow, or as much as $(1-0.1) \times (1-0.1)\times 100 = 81$ today.

\




*Strategic behaviour in interactions:* Common knowledge of rationality, Nash equilibrium?

\

We can find behaviour and outcomes that seem to contradict the above assumptions (see, e.g., DellaVigna, 2009). This 'non-classical' behaviour is (arguably) common, significant, and follows predictable patterns. Should we then *stop learning classical economics?*

\


### Classical economists are not naïve

They know preferences change, people make mistakes, etc.

Justifications include:

- ‘Most people, most of the time,’ and many mistakes will be ‘fixed’ by the market.
- Strong predictive power
- 'Normative':  how we 'should' behave to get the best outcomes
- A good starting point, framework for insight, benchmark

\

### Behavioural Economics

Relaxes some of the assumptions above, usually one at a time

\

Does not typically 'reject rationality' (instead we hear of 'bounded rationality')


\

Most “behavioral models” involve some sort of optimization (and often equilibrium)! There are ‘pure behavioral theorists’ who try to find parsimonious models to explain deviations.

*Most influential authors: Kahneman and Tversky*

\

### Modern consensus/entente

Both classical and behavioural economics are useful

- Different models and techniques (for different spheres?)


```{block2,  type='note'}

**A 'compromise' position?** ...  It is worth testing for, and admitting the possibility of 'systematic violations' of the classical assumptions.

*Classical* economics is usually more relevant for firm behavior But Classical may (or may not) predict well for *aggregates* and for *firm behaviour*.  *Behavioural models* may predict better for individual behaviour in isolation \

... but behavioural admits many possibilities and heterogeneous behavior, so it makes broad predictions difficult \

Behavioural insights are (probably) useful in making policy (and in marketing).

Evidence from the lab and small scale field settings may be informative, but some 'behavioural anomalies' may be inconsequential in larger markets in equilibrium}

```


## Limits to Human Decision Making: An Overview

Ww might classify  four general ways people diverge from classical assumptions

1. Limited cognitive ability – difficult and costly to make complex decisions

2. Limited willpower – self control problems

3. Limited self interest – care about others (fairness, altruism), issues beyond income/consumption

4. Inconsistent, changing, and 'non-outcome-based' preferences \*


<div class="marginnote">
Under (e.g.) Prospect Theory people may be acting to maximise their true preferences, \
 but their true preferences may change depending on reference points etc.}
</div>

### Limited cognitive ability

- Complexity of problems
    - Optimising calculations take time; this may *itself* be a cost
        - A 'simplifying decision-making rule' (rule-of-thumb) may be better if it saves these costs
    - Relevant both to individual decision-making (consumption, investment) and strategic choices
        - Game theory: recall 'iterated strict dominance' and 'backwards induction'

- People (seem to) systematically misunderstand probabilities (and other maths concepts)

\

#### Application: lack of financial literacy {-}

- Consumers who underestimated interest rates in quizzes held the highest interest loans in real life
- Particularly when government 'truth in lending laws' were lax


*Evidence from Stango and Zinman, 2011*

*A 'quiz...'*

```{block2,  type='fold'}


1. Suppose you had £100 in a savings account and the interest rate was 2\% per year. After 5 years, how much do you think you would have in the account if you left the money to grow:

\

A. More than £102
\

B. Exactly £102
\



\

2. Imagine that the interest rate on your savings account was 1 percent per year and inflation was 2 percent per year. After 1 year, would you be able to buy:

\

A. more than
\

B. exactly the same as, or
\

C. less than today

\

3. Do you think that the following statement is true or false? ‘Buying a single company stock usually provides a safer return than a stock mutual fund.’

(True/False)

```

\

Answers:
```{block2,  type='fold'}

1. A

2. C

3. false
```


\

\medskip

Around the world, across many studies, less than half answer *all three* of the above questions correctly.

Lusardi and Mitchell, 2013; In Germany and Switzerland, just over 50\% get all three right.  In most other surveyed countries, the numbers are far lower.  E.g., in the USA 65\% get the interest rate question right, 64\% the inflation question, and 52\% the diversification question.

## Limited willpower and 'hyperbolic discounting'

[Marshmallow test](https://youtu.be/d8M7Xzjy_m8?t=3)

*Notes:*

In the 1960's-70's Stanford experiment. Children could have 1 marshmallow now or 2 in 15 minutes if they could resist temptation. \
There is some evidence that this correlates to later life outcomes (test scores, degrees, BMI, etc). \

Strong results; interpretation debated.


```{block2,  type='note'}

The strongest results have failed to replicate. See a popular discussion [here](https://www.vox.com/science-and-health/2018/6/6/17413000/marshmallow-test-replication-mischel-psychology).

\

There is also some criticism of the results' *interpretation*. The kid's behavior may not have only been driven by impatience but also on how much they trusted the experimenters. Those kids brought up in low-trust environments may have trusted the experimenters less to 'come through' with the second marshmallow. They also may have tended to have other obstacles to their academic and professional success.

```

\

Monday-David wants Tuesday-David to give up 1 marshmallow for 2 marshmallows on Wednesday. \

\

`r format_with_col("But Monday-David unwilling to give up 1 marshmallow for 2 marshmallows on Tuesday.","olive")` \

\

`r format_with_col("Similarly, Tuesday-David won't give up 1 marshmallow for 2 on Wednesday","brown")`

\

- Inconsistency: Monday-David thinks Tuesday-David is acting sub-optimally!
    - Is David acting in his own interest? Can we even define his 'true utility'?

\

Hyperbolic discounting (simple version)
:     Steep drop in 'weight $w$' on payoffs earned after the current period

\

- But constant weight (or constant discounting) for payoffs multiple periods in the future
    - This leads to inconsistencies between 'planned' and chosen behaviour

\

Compare two 'streams of payoffs'

\

1. Work: -10 today, +2 for the next 6 days

2. Lazy: -5 today, +1 for next 6 days


*Examples:* Should you...?

study very hard on Sunday to be prepared for the whole week, \
Get a good workout to feel energized the whole week \
Clean your flat on Sunday .... etc.

\

Grasshopper weights payoffs today, tomorrow, and every day the same: $w=1$

- Monday, Grasshopper compares Work to Lazy, and chooses Work.
    - payoff(Work) $= -10 + (2 \times 6) = 2$
    - payoff(Lazy) $= -5 + (1 \times 6) = 1$

\

Ant always weights payoffs at 1 today and $w=1/2$ on any future day

- Monday, Ant chooses Lazy:
    - payoff(Work) $= -10 +(2 \times 6)/2 = -4$
    - payoff(Lazy) $= -5 + (1 \times 6)/2 = -2$

\

If Grasshopper were 'choosing for Monday on Sunday', he would choose Work $\rightarrow$ Consistent

\

But if Ant were 'choosing for Monday on Sunday', he would choose Work $\rightarrow$ Inconsistent

\

- On Sunday he considers
    - payoff(Work Monday) $= (-10 + 2 \times 6)/2 = 1$
    - payoff(Lazy Monday) $= (-5 + 1 \times 6)/2 = 1/2$
- But as we saw, on Monday he chooses to be lazy
- Would he 'benefit from pre-committing?'


## Limited self-interest ... e.g, altruism and fairness

'Other-regarding preferences':  My utility may be impacted by...

1.  Other people's utility, or their consumption of particular 'merit' goods

E.g., I suffer if I know my neighbour suffers, or her child eats too little
 $\rightarrow$ this implies  'aid to the poor' may become a public good; thus it  may be massively under-provided in a voluntary setting

\

2. My perceived 'impact' on outcomes

- If I donate to charity, I feel better
- If my contribution improves people's lives, protects the environment (relative to my having done nothing)
- $\rightarrow$ People may make choices reducing their own consumption, to increase other's consumption
- Charitable giving is widespread; accounts for about 1\% of UK GDP
- 'Donations' to family members much higher


```{block2,  type='note'}

The utilities, and decisions, of family members are highly connected. There is an ongoing debate and research programme considering when to model a household's decisions as 'unitary' and when to consider the individual preferences of the household members.

```

\

'Other-regarding preferences':  My utility may be impacted by...

1. My reputation and how others perceive me

$\rightarrow$ Thus people may donate  and cooperate more when they are observed by others.

\

2. How 'fair' I believe the outcomes and actions taken are

- $\rightarrow$ People reject significant positive offers in ultimatum games and bargaining
    - Anticipating this, people make offers considerably above zero

- $\rightarrow$ People cooperate when they expect others to do so

- $\rightarrow$ people engage in 'costly punishment' of others they believe acted unfairly

\



\

**Rational altruism?**

We can model some forms of other-regarding preferences using standard tools, like indifference curves and budget constraints:

### Converting from 'material payoffs' to 'psychological payoffs' {#psych-payoffs}

As we have previously noted, the 'real' payoffs in a game (or an individual decision) may not be identical to the monetary/material payoffs

(Important to note, this is a *distinct issue* from 'diminishing marginal utility' and risk-aversion.)

\



Motives like 'fairness' may transform monetary payoffs into 'real' payoffs in a straightforward way

\
E.g., in the ultimatum game, suppose player 1's real payoffs are:

\


$$U_1(Y_1,Y_2) = Y_1 - |Y_1-Y_2|$$


\


Where $Y_1$ is the amount 1 earns from the ultimatum game, and $Y_2$ is 2's income from this game.


\


Similarly for player 2:


$$U_2(Y_2,Y_1) = Y_2 - |Y_1-Y_2|$$


\


*Here each player gains 1 unit of utility for each pound they earn, but loses a unit of utility for every pound of difference between the payoffs.*



```{r  fig.cap = '', out.width='80%', fig.asp=.4, fig.align='center',  echo = FALSE}
 knitr::include_graphics(file.path("picsfigs","ultimatumgametree.png"))

```{r  fig.cap = '', out.width='80%', fig.asp=.4, fig.align='center',  echo = FALSE}
 knitr::include_graphics(file.path("picsfigs","ultimatumfairness.png"))
```


**Notes on the above:**

Here if earnings are equal, real payoffs are the same as earnings; 0,0 or 5,5 \
Where earnings are unequal, player-1 gets 9 and player-2 gets 1 from material payoffs. \
But because of a difference of 8 in earnings, both players lose 8 in psychological payoffs \
so the net real payoffs if player-1 offered 1 and 2 accepted would be 9-8=1 for player-1 and 1-8=-7 for player-2. \
Using BWI here we see the subgame perfect NE will be that player-1 offers 5 and player-2 accepts.

\

'Envy payoffs'

```{r  fig.cap = '', out.width='85%', fig.asp=.4, fig.align='center',  echo = FALSE}
 knitr::include_graphics(file.path("picsfigs","ultimatumenvy.png"))
```


**Notes and explanation of  the above:** (unfold)

```{block2,  type='fold'}

Here we assume because of 'envy', real payoffs equal material payoffs minus the difference in payoffs *for the player with lower payoffs only.* \
For the outcomes considered, only player-2's payoffs are adjusted from the material payoffs; \
she gets 1-8 = -7 from accepting an offer of 1; her payoff is 1 but she loses 7 in envy. \
Because of this she will not accept such an offer. Knowing this, player-1 will offer 5.
```



### Supplemental (reading): Evidence on the Ultimatum Game


Guth et al. (1982) presented the first experimental test of the ultimatum game.

\
This game has two players: a  Proposer and a Responder

\
Proposer has a pie of size 1. She must propose a split of the pie between the two players $(1-s, s)$

\

The Responder may:

- accept (in which case the split is executed)
- reject (in which case both players get zero


\

This is a 'take it or leave it offer' in bargaining. What do you think he/she will offer?  Do you think he/she will accept?  Why or why not?

<!---
\
Now let us try this on veconlab, along with a simple 'Dictator' game
http://veconlab.econ.virginia.edu/login.htm
login to "elsb2"
The prize is
\
> This program runs a two-person, bargaining game. In the Dictator version, one person simply decides unilaterally how to split a fixed amount of money. In the Ultimatum treatment, the proposer makes an offer of how to split the money, which the responder either accepts or rejects. An acceptance implements the proposed split, and a rejection results in zero earnings for both.
\
\
"Random lottery incentive"
I will randomly choose 1 stage/repetition for 2 participants for payment, and pay based on the actual choices.
\
-->
\


### Ultimatum game: theoretical predictions

Allowing 'non-credible threats', this game has as many Nash equilibria as there are possible splits of the pie.


In each of them, the Responder's strategy is to 'accept only if offered X (or more)' for some $X\geq0$, and the Proposer's strategy is to offer exactly X.


But maybe these equilibria don't seem like reasonable predictions (why?)

\

Q: What does SPNE predict (use backwards induction)?


- If the split is $(1,0)$, the Responder is indifferent between accepting and rejecting

- That still means the Proposer offering $(1,0)$ and the Responder accepting is a NE

\

The subgame-perfect Nash equilibrium is found by solving the game backwards:

The Proposer (correctly) anticipates the Responder will accept any offer

- Thus she offers zero, which is accepted 'in equilibrium'

(A 'near zero' offer would lead to a similar result, and might seem more intuitive)

`r format_with_col("Note, that these are basic game theoretic predictions, not Behavioral.","gray")`

\

#### What happens in experiments? {-}

```{block2,  type='inputq'}
What do you think will happen?
```

\

- A 50-50 split is the most common offer

- Responders tend to reject offers giving them less than 30\%, even when this is a lot of money.


\


Potential explanations for the above

- Fairness concerns; monetary payoffs may not represent actual payoffs

- Proposers may anticipate this, and thus offer more than the minimum to avoid their offer being rejected.  (Also, proposers may themselves have fairness preferences.)

## Discussion
- Let's look at our results (and pay)
- What do you think explained your choices? What did you think other people would do?
- What real-world situations does this resemble?
    - In what ways does this differ from a 'typical' bargaining situation

\


## Application: Give-if-you-win (EU vs. Prospect theory)


```{r  fig.cap = '', out.width='80%', fig.asp=.4, fig.align='center',  echo = FALSE}
 knitr::include_graphics(file.path("picsfigs","borisbanks.png"))
```

\

**EU over outcomes predicts these choices will be the same.**

Here, in choosing *conditional* choices 'if I win' etc., the decision for each state (win or lose) are separate.

- Max $EU = pr(win)u(win,choice if win) + pr(lose)u(lose,choice if lose)$
- Choice for 'if I win' does *not* affect payoff 'if I lose'

\

**Before** I know the outcome, I may anticipate what my utility-maximising donation $g^*$ would be if I win the bonus

- Let $c$ be own consumption, $Y$ income pre-bonus, $w$ the bonus amount, and $g_b$ the committed donation 'if I  win $w$'

- I choose $g_b$ to maximize utility $u(c, g)$ s.t. budget constraint $c+g \leq Y+w$

- If asked to pre-commit 'if I win', I commit to that choice, so $g_b=g^*$

\

**After** I have won the bonus $w$, I maximize utility $u(c, g)$ s.t. budget constraint $c+g \leq Y+w$

- Same maximisation as above, so $g_a=g_b=g^*$


\

**However, other models predict distinct choices with the Before and After asks**

**Reputation:** If I give to benefit my reputation or self-esteem, *unrealised* donations may matter, not just donation outcomes

- This may be an incentive to commit *more* the less likely a donation needs to be paid
- 'If I win the lottery megabucks, I will give it all away'

\

**Loss aversion:** If I am 'loss averse' over my own consumption, it may seem 'cheaper' to commit before I win the bonus than after

Why? Because my *reference point* may change. Suppose I've £50k income and a potential £50k bonus with 50% probability

- Before winning my reference consumption may be the EV, £75k

- So a conditional donation to donate £10k if I have a total income+bonus of £100k may not seem like a loss

- But after I win the bonus, my new reference consumption may be £100k

- So each pound donated might feel like a loss

\

**What do you think happens when you ask people to donate either Before-conditionally or After winning a prize or bonus?**
Do they  commit more 'before' than they give 'after', or vice versa, or are these equivalent?

### Field experiment {-}

**One field experiment: University of Essex undergraduate students**

\

**Emails from DAs on behalf of FSS**

<small>  Subject: Employability promotion -- a 1 in 4 chance of winning a £20 prize for doing a short survey. </small>
\

<small> Text: Please go to [*web site*] --  we have 80 free dinners for two in Colchester to give away, worth £20 each and at least 40 £20 Amazon vouchers!! If you log on, you will have a one in four overall chance of winning one of these prizes! </small>

\

<small> Details:  `r format_with_col("2 rounds over 2 academic years","gray")`. `r format_with_col("2 prizes in round 1, Amazon  only in round 2.","gray")`
First covering Faculty of Social Science, then all departments. Sign in with email, orthogonal employability treatments.</small>

$\rightarrow$ 352 valid responses with donation opportunities

\


## Inconsistent preferences; examples considering decisions under uncertainty (simple treatment)

### Allais paradox - what could be the explanation?

... As presented and discussed above, in section \@ref(#allais) \@ref(allais)

\

**SO WHY do people choose B over A and D over C?**

- One theory: People overweight small probabilities
    - $\rightarrow$  Gamble A: the 1\% chance of 0 is treated as larger?

We consider this and other possible explanations below, but first we consider one more paradox...

\

### Kahneman and Tversky scenariae {-}

`r format_with_col("Warning: This is not the standard Allais paradox, it is a different paradox.","red")`

**KT1. Which would you choose?** \

You get £1000 upfront. \

- Gamble $A$: You have an 50\% chance of winning an additional £1,000.

- Gamble $B$: An additional £500 with certainty.

*Write down: which would you choose?*

\hrulefill

\

**KT1. Which would you choose?** \

You get £2000 upfront. \

- Gamble $C$: You have a 50\% chance of losing £1,000.

- Gamble $D$: You lose £500 with certainty.


\hrulefill




**KT1:** You get £1000 upfront. \


- Gamble $A$: You have a 50\% chance of winning an additional £1,000.

- Gamble $B$: An additional £500 with certainty.


\hrulefill

**KT1:** You get £2000 upfront. \

- Gamble $C$: You have a 50\% chance of losing £1,000.

- Gamble $D$: Lose £500 with certainty.

\


\hrulefill

KT (hypothetical) experiment: 16\% of subjects chose $A$ over $B$, and 68\% chose $C$ over $D$

- *But $A$ is the same as $C$ (50/50 chance of £1000 or £2000),*
- *and $B$ is the same as $D$ (certain £1500)!*

Seems to depend on how we 'frame' these.

### Explaining the above paradoxes with prospect theory

- Above choices: cannot be explained by 'regular' EU theory
    - Mistakes, misunderstanding probabilities?
    - Prospect theory, loss-aversion: *not* mistakes, but maximising something other than EU

\


### Prospect theory -- loss aversion (LA) part {-}

1. People don't think only about *outcomes* but about 'gains or losses relative to a reference point'
1. Outcomes considered *losses* are particular painful
1. Whether an outcome is a *loss* depends on the reference point
    - which may depend on how a decision is framed
    - or on the starting point, or initial expectations


\

$\rightarrow$ may make decisions to 'avoid losses' \
that we wouldn't make if we saw it as 'increasing gains'

\

### Standard and loss-averse utility {-}

 knitr::include_graphics(file.path("picsfigs","std_u_prospect_u.png"))
```

<div class="marginnote">
Source: Nicholson and Snyder, 2012
</div>


*Notes:*
What leads to the paradoxes and 'inconsistent behaviour'? \
 The fact that the reference point can vary depending on things that are 'irrelevant' from an EU perspective



\

### KT experiment with prospect theory (loss aversion) {-}

**KT1:** £1000 upfront. \

- Gamble $A$: You have an 50\% chance of winning an additional £1,000.
- Gamble $B$: An additional £500 with certainty.

\

\hrulefill

**KT2:** £2000 upfront. \

- Gamble $C$: You have an 50\% chance of losing £1,000.
- Gamble $D$: You lose £500 with certainty.


\hrulefill

\

- In KT1, your reference point may be £1000.
    - Choose between A---a small certain gain and B---a larger uncertain gain; with same EV
    - ... standard risk aversion predicts choosing B
- In KT1, your reference point may be £2000.
    - Choose between C---a possible large loss and D---a certain smaller loss (with same EV)
    - ... standard risk aversion predicts choosing D
    - But if feeling of *loss* is very painful, may choose C>D to have a 50\% chance of avoiding pain


*Note:* This may help explain why some problem gamblers incur larger and larger losses to try to 'make up' for bad performance earlier in the day.

```

\

Framing effect
:     The same choice, presented in two different ways, may lead to different decisions.

\

### Allais redux: loose prospect theory (Loss Aversion) explanation {-}

*Note:* We previously mentioned misweighting probabilities as an explanation for this. \
 An alternative explanation could be loss-aversion

- A: 89\% chance of £1,000, a 10\% chance of £5,000, 1\% chance of 0.
- B: £1,000 with certainty.
- C: 89\% chance of 0 and 11\% chance of £1,000.
- D: 90\% chance of 0 and 10\% chance of £5,000.

\

- Considering A \& B, the ref. point may be close to £1000, as this can be had with certainty.
    -  A seem to 'risk a costly loss of £1000', thus may choose 'safer' $B>A$, notwithstanding its far lower EV (£1000 vs £1390)

\


- Considering D \& C, ref. point may be close to 0, as EV's of each are low, \& 0 is likeliest outcome
    - So 'don't worry about losses', choose D > C bc higher EV (£500 vs. £110)

## Supplement: Fortune Cookie Wisdom {#fortune}

Here are some broad lessons that I hope you take away from this module, And that will help you throughout... I will come back to these.

```{r  fig.cap = '', out.width='50%', fig.asp=.4, fig.align='center',  echo = FALSE}
 knitr::include_graphics(file.path("picsfigs","fortunecookieyoda.jpg"))
```

\textrm{Economists do not know everything: We know very little but we have thought through many arguments}

*It may seem like we have the answers, but this is only where we have asked the questions very carefully*

***

\textrm{Most non-economists do not fully understand these arguments, and they make mistakes, and they worry.}

- But sometimes ignorance is bliss.

*Examples:* Sunk-cost fallacy, gains to trade/comparative advantage, opportunity cost,
free-riding/prisoners' dilemma, double-marginalization,'raise price to raise profit', etc.

<!--
Todo: add in-document links to the above
-->

I've had many discussions about these things with my non-economist wife. Some of them make her more sanguine and content; other stress her out.

***

\textrm{Humans are not like billiard balls, universal rules are hard to come by.}

We are building models based on very precisely defined assumptions, usually assuming things like a 'single representative consumer'. These models are seductive and very helpful for clearly conveying insights.

However, when it comes to applying these things to the real world, or testing these models, be careful;  people may differ and they may change and they may have multiple motives.

\

Although we are not focusing on 'market failure' in this module (BEEM101, 2020)...

I don't want you to go away thinking that economists believe, 'markets solve everything, markets yield the best of all possible worlds'.  The simplest models do aim to show the conditions under which this holds, but that is not a good characterization of most economic work. Most economists recognize the existence of market failures, and I believe that most recognize the usefulness of government intervention in many cases. Difference of opinion mainly arise over the prevalence of these market failures, and the extent to which government can do a good job of fixing them, or ends up making things worse.

I'm not telling you what *you* need to believe, I just don't want you to have a false impression of mainstream Economics.


I also believe that these apparent imperfections or market failures actually can lead to opportunities to create value and profit. Things that were once market failures might be solved by technology or new  frameworks.

<br>\bigskip

Here are some possible examples.
\


*Imperfection:* Inefficient monopoly markups for information goods \


$\rightarrow$ 'All you can eat'  $\rightarrow$ `r format_with_col("Spotify, Netflix, Kindle Unlimited","blue")` \
\

`r format_with_col("When people who value certain goods which could be shared with them at no cost, are nonetheless priced out of this market, this represents an inefficiency. The only price per unit that will lead to the efficient amount of consumption Would here be a zero price. However, firms and content providers cannot stay in business with zero prices. On the other hand, if they can get a good signal of what people would be willing to pay for 'all-you-can-eat' And then charges this to them as a subscription fee, Those consumers who subscribe will then consume the efficient amount. This represents an example of a two-part tariff, a form of price discrimination which may actually increase welfare. We will learn more about price discrimination later.","gray")`



Free-riding on public goods \

$\rightarrow$ `r format_with_col("Disneyworld, resorts","ForestGreen")` \


\
`r format_with_col("We will see that markets will not provide the efficient amount of certain goods that are non-rival and non-excludable. However (as for the information goods case), 4 large enough territory some of these things like fireworks can essentially be made excludable. Disney World has fireworks every night, and they own such a large property that they can exclude people from coming anywhere near where the fireworks are being shown, so it would be hard to free ride.  They then charge an admission fee to 'be inside of Disney World' and then they want to make the experience of being inside Disney World as nice as possible, so they produce a great deal of what would otherwise be considered public goods.","gray")`


Imperfection: Lack of information about 'experience goods', lack of trust in one-shot-interactions\


$\rightarrow$ `r format_with_col("Uber, AirBnb","ForestGreen")` \

\

Another potential market failure comes from Asymmetric information (we won't cover this in detail); consumers may not know the quality of a product until after they have purchased it. In some cases, this means no one may be able to sell a certain product because consumers will not trust its quality, the so-called 'lemons problem' or 'adverse selection'. Reputation systems, particular those developed on Internet sites like Uber and Air B&B, can help reduce this problem and create new markets (and profit for themselves).

***


Shyness and fear of 'losing face' \



$\rightarrow$ `r format_with_col("Tinder","ForestGreen")`


Perhaps two people want to work together, or socialize or romance each other. However they may both be afraid of the consequences of being rejected. Even though both would like to be 'partnered', neither will make an overture to the other because the risks seem too high.

A third-party intermediary, man or machine,  could be set up to only share information about 'Mutual matches'. Once again, this will create fruitful transactions and the intermediary may be also be able to profit.

`r format_with_col("If you're interested, see my research on this","gray")` [here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/tx4yfun1ctxuezw/LosingFace.pdf?dl=0), presentation slides [here](http://wp.me/aZhn3-c8), my research page is [here](https://wordpress.com/page/davidreinstein.wordpress.com/18).

<br> \bigskip


Asymmetric information, adverse selection  \


$\rightarrow$ `r format_with_col("NHS, 'Obamacare'","ForestGreen")`

This one *is* a government intervention, obviously. However, private corporations are very deeply involved in these markets and healthcare systems; even in the UK, where healthcare Is perhaps more Directly provided by the government than anywhere else in the world, there are private providers like BUPA.

Insurance markets can fail because of a problem of 'adverse selection'. A given set of insurance policies will tend to be more attractive to those people who envision their at more risk; in the context of health insurance, more likely to become sick and require hospitalization. Because of this, insurance companies will need to charge rates that reflect risks for the less healthy population. Because of this, healthier people may be 'priced out of the market', i.e., prefer to not obtain insurance. This may be inefficient because Even these healthy people may be 'risk-averse', and would benefit from purchasing 'actuarially fair insurance' (We will define these terms later).

There is a strong case to be made that a mandate to purchase insurance (or system of fines and subsidies) can improve overall outcomes in these situations. This is the logic behind several healthcare systems and proposals, including the USA Affordable Care Act passed under the Obama administration, and some aspects of the Netherlands' system as well.

<br> \bigskip

*Note:* Firms themselves do not typically use markets: if we look inside the firm and see all sorts of mechanisms to correct or circumvent internal markets. Understanding when and why firms do this, and the trade-offs involved, can help you be a better manager. For example, when should you 'outsource' and when should you keep a task in house? When should you offer employees very strong incentives and when should you just tell them what to do?

Empirical research

:     Uses evidence from the *real world*, i.e., observation, to answer questions (rather than introspection and theory)


<br> \bigskip

Econometrics
:     The 'science' of using data to answer economic questions
:     Uses statistical tools and often economic theory


<br> \bigskip

Micro-data
:     Data where the unit of observation is an individual, household, firm, etc.
:     `r format_with_col("(Contrasts from macro-data, data on aggregates like GDP, inflation, etc.)","gray")`

See, e.g.,

- [Euro-stat microdata](https://www.eui.eu/Research/Library/ResearchGuides/Economics/Statistics/DataPortal/EurostatPublicUse)

- [Data on individual donations (at the donor level) from a large scale field experiment (Karlan and List) downloadable HERE](https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi%3A10.7910/DVN/27853)

\

'Macro-data'

This is contrasted from 'Macro-data' which is aggregated/averaged in some way (e.g., at the country-level or industry-level)

E.g.,

\
Econometrics often has a different focus and different methodology than 'regular statistics'. Econometrics has taken on a larger role in economics over the past 40 years, because of greater data availability and computing power.  Most published papers in Economics now involve some econometric (i.e., empirical) analysis.

Throughout the module we will come back to the discussion of empirical work, testing, measuring, and estimating.


### Empirical meta-example

Suppose we are trying to estimate the market demand curve; suppose we hypothesize that this demand curve is a linear function.
(I.e., suppose we assume that quantity demanded is a linear function of price).

$$Q_d = a-bp$$

Suppose we know that price is changing because of cost changes, shifts in supply curve, or the firm experimenting.

`r format_with_col(" Otherwise the problem is poorly identified, as demand and supply will jointly determine price","RawSienna")`

We observe price and quantity data for a period where *ceteris paribus* is reasonable, such as the data below^[From https://medium.com/teconomics-blog/how-to-get-the-price-right-9fda84a33fe5; see article for explanation on why this is 'residual' price and quantity, if you are interested.]


```{r  fig.cap = '', out.width='70%', fig.asp=.4, fig.align='center',  echo = FALSE}
 knitr::include_graphics("picsfigs/demanddata.png")
```

We try to fit the 'best' line through these points (minimizing the distances between the line and the points, or minimizing the 'error' of this predicted quantity).  We estimate the demand curve's slope and intercept. We can use this to make inferences.

This line will never fit exactly, because of unobserved differences, nonlinear demand, measurement error, randomness in behaviour.

But this fitted line is *only* meaningful if we are observing shifts in the *supply curve and not the demand curve*! `r format_with_col("(Can you explain why?)","blue")`

\


**Some more in-depth discussions of estimating demand and/or supply curves:**

[From Econometric online text,  Shalabh, IIT Kanpur](\href{)http://home.iitk.ac.in/~shalab/econometrics/Chapter17-Econometrics-SimultaneousEquationsModels.pdf)


[Notes on estimating these models in R using 2sls](http://rstudio-pubs-static.s3.amazonaws.com/195495_d47be7c818424a3c9bfa5452dd17c6c6.html)

\

### Ceteris paribus

> All [most] economic theories employ the assumption that 'other things are held constant.'

- In above data/figure, demand may differ between weeks/stores, weather may change, etc.
- 'the points may lie on several different demand curves, and attempting to force them into a single curve would be a mistake.'
    - $\rightarrow$ We would like to carefully 'control' for other observable factors

 `r format_with_col("May also use flexible functions permitting heterogeneity -- differing *slopes","RawSienna")`.*

We can never control for everything or know 'true' functional form. Sadly, all *empirical* work involves imperfect compromises.

But happily there are ways to test and validate the estimates, e.g., see how well they predict future outcomes.


### Exogenous and endogenous variables

Suppose a model of supply and demand with 'exogenous shifters':

- $W$ is an external or *exogenous* variable that increases the quantity demanded at any price
    - E.g., the amount of a windfall tax rebate, boosting net income

- $Z$ is an *exogenous* variable that makes production more costly, increasing the price firms require to supply a particular quantity
    - E.g., the level of the minimum wage, or e.g., energy prices

\

<br> \bigskip


We can then write the supply and demand model as:
$$Q=-P+W$$
$$P=Q+Z$$

- P and Q are the *endogenous* variables
    - Don't ask 'how does P change in Q?'
- W and Z are the *exogenous* variables
    - If we know W and Z we can solve for the equilibrium Q and P
    - Can observe how this equilibrium responds to shifts in Q and P

## Supplement: Gains to voluntary trade {#gain-to-trade}


Indifference curves and 'convex combinations' give us insight into why people trade with one another. It may seem obvious but historically and even in the present, some people see trade as a zero-sum game, with a winner and a loser.  But if this were the case, why would both parties sometimes consent to making such a trade?

Considering [figure to be added]
 , an individual is ok with giving up soda for hamburgers or vice/versa *along* her indifference curve. A trade that put her *above* the IC makes her 'strictly' better off.

*So consider if one individual had allocation D and another allocation A, and they had the same preferences.*

```{block2,  type='inputqn'}
What trade could they make to make each of them better off?
```


\

 Note that a straight line between these two points describes the combinations of
'shares of bundles A and D adding up to 1' (e.g., 1/3 of D and 2/3 of A) or 'trading a fraction of bundle D for the same fraction of bundle A, and vice versa.'

E.g., a 50-50 split of each bundle yields, in this case, (6+2)/2 = 4 hamburgers and (2+6)/2=4 soft drinks.

```{block2,  type='note'}

Note that the line between two bundles depicts all 'convex combinations' of these $\alpha$ of D and $1-\alpha$ of A, where $\alpha \in (0,1)$.

In normal-speak, a partial share of each bundle.

We can see that with the same DMRS for both, trades along this line make both better off; the *points* they would trade to depends on their bargaining power. They might also trade in a way that puts one below this line but still above the original indifference curve.

```

<div class="marginnote">
For an alternative depiction using indifference curves, where preference differ but allocations are the same, see the online text [HERE](https://2012books.lardbucket.org/books/microeconomics-principles-v1.0/s10-03-indifference-curve-analysis-an.html#:~:text=An%20indifference%20curve%20shows%20combinations,tangent%20to%20the%20budget%20line) under 'Case in Point: Preferences Prevail in P.O.W. Camps'

\

However, trade between two individuals is better illustrated using an "Edgeworth box", see, e.g., the explanation [HERE on economicsdiscussion.net](https://www.economicsdiscussion.net/essays/economics/exchange-between-two-individuals-gain-from-trade/1207).
</div>



## Supplement: Quasiconcavity (of utility function/preferences) {#quasi-conc}

This is the 'preferred assumption' which resembles convexity, but has several advantages as a concept. For example, it doesn't require differentiable preferences, and its properties are not affected by monotonic transformations of utility functions. This is the concept that you might be taught in a PhD module. I think it may also have some value in understanding optimization problems in general, which is an important part of research and industry and finance, I believe.


More formal concept: (strictly) convex preferences $\Leftrightarrow$  (strictly) **'quasiconcave' utility function**, allowing 'n goods':

This essentially means that for a 'convex combination' of any two bundles $\mathbf{A}=(X_A,Y_A)$ and $\mathbf{D}=(X_D,Y_D)$

$$U(\alpha\mathbf{A}+(1-\alpha)\mathbf{D})\geq\alpha U(\mathbf{A}) + (1-\alpha)U(\mathbf{D})$$

where $0<\alpha<1$.

<div class="marginnote">
 Note the switch to a 'weak inequality' here for quasiconcavity, strict for 'strict quasiconcavity'*)
</div>

\

E.g. (with two goods),


$$U(\alpha X_A + (1-\alpha)X_D,\alpha Y_A + (1-\alpha)Y_D) \geq $$

$$\alpha(U((X_A,Y_A)) + (1-\alpha)(U(X_D,Y_D)$$

where $0<\alpha<1$.

\

We also describe it as having 'a convex upper contour set': the set of all bundles strictly preferred to a particular bundle is a 'convex set', implying it contains all convex combinations of elements of this set.

\

One reason economists like this 'quasiconcavity' is because it rules out the 'false summits',
the local, but not global optima, so we only need to use the first-order conditions to find the optima.

<div class="marginnote">

But is this '[looking under the streetlight](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streetlight_effect) to find our keys' or is it truly without loss of generality?

</div>


\

Without quasiconcavity there may also be no demand *function* only a *demand correspondence*: at a given price and income there may be more than one optimising choice!

```{block2,  type='inputq'}
Can you illustrate this with 'double-humped' indifference curves?
```

\


Gravelle and Reese appendix, on constrained optimisation (unfold)

```{block2,  type='fold'}

> A local maximum is always a global maximum if (a) the objective function is quasiconcave, and (b) the feasible set is convex.

It will also tend to rule out 'sharp jumps' in response to price changes, so we can look smoothly at 'comparitive statics.'

Note that 'quasiconcavity' does not require differentiability.

Furthermore, unlike properties like 'diminishing marginal rates of substitution' this is preserved under a 'monotonic transformation' (stretching). This means it is called an 'ordinal property'.  Essentially, quasiconcave utility functions yields indifference curves that are 'convex to the origin'.

All relevant properties of utility functions are unchanged by such monotonic transformations, including the MRS. This is well-illustrated in Autor's reading (Lecture 3, pp 11-14)

```

## Supplement: Constrained optimization (with many goods), Lagrangian method {#lagrange}

The constrained problem is equivalent to optimising a single unconstrained 'Lagrangian' function.

\

See Autor notes ([Lecture 4: Theory of Choice and Individual Demand](https://dspace.mit.edu/bitstream/handle/1721.1/109484/14-03-fall-2010/contents/lecture-notes/MIT14_03F10_lec04.pdf))

- This yields the above optimisation (first-order) conditions

- but only where solutions are positive; there are additional non-negativity constraints,
    - $\rightarrow$ should use Kuhn-Tucker 'complementary slackness' conditions;
    - however, if an unconstrained problem yields a solution that doesn't violate the contraint, we can ignore it.

```{r  fig.cap = 'From Autor notes', out.width='90%', fig.asp=.4, fig.align='center',  echo = FALSE}

 knitr::include_graphics(file.path("picsfigs","consumerlagrangian.png"))
```

```{r  fig.cap = '', out.width='90%', fig.asp=.4, fig.align='center',  echo = FALSE}
 knitr::include_graphics(file.path("picsfigs","solutioninngoods.png"))
```

We could have derived this without the Lagrangian, simply substituting in the constraint for one good:

$$x=\frac{I-yp_y- ....}{p_x}$$ ... subtracting the expense on all other goods.

And then solving this unconstrained problem. Taking the derivative of the solved optimum this with respect to the income term $I$ will give us a similar expression as $\lambda$, expressing the 'shadow value'... the increase in utility for an increase in income.

\

The conditions for an optimum can also be written in vector notation as:


$$\nabla U(\mathbf{x^\ast})= \lambda\mathbf{p}$$


The 'gradient vector' of the partial derivatives of utility wrt each element of $x$, evaluated at the optimum will be proportional to the vector of prices.

When two vectors $\mathbf{A}$ and $\mathbf{B}$ are in the same direction, i.e., $\mathbf{A}=c\mathbf{B}$, no matter their length, the *planes* perpendicular to this vector are the same plane. (And all vectors *along* those planes are perpendicular to vectors $\mathbf{A}$ and $\mathbf{B}$).


\

This implies that at optimum 'the rate of increase in utility is greatest in the direction of the vector tangent to the budget line (plane)'...

Which tells us that the plane tangent to the '(multi-dimensional) indifference surface' at this point is the budget plane.


## Supplement: Primal and dual of demand (max and min), Hicksian demand, Identities, Slutskly equation {#dual}

### Primal and dual -- functions and relationships (doctoral prep):

```{r  fig.cap = '', out.width='75%', fig.asp=.4, fig.align='center',  echo = FALSE}
 knitr::include_graphics(file.path("picsfigs","axioms.png"))
```



<br> <br> \bigskip


Indirect utility function: the (max) utility you can get as a function of your income and prevailing prices.

$$V(p_x,p_y,I_0)=max_{x,y}U(x,y) \text{ s.t. }  p_xx+p_yy\leq I$$

Here this is the *max* and not the *argmax* ... it's the actual *utility* level not the consumption level(s). (The consumption levels are the *Marshallian* demand.)

*We can find by solving for the utility-maximising choices, and then plugging these in to compute the utility from these.*


<br> <br> \bigskip


Expenditure function: How much income you need to to get a certain utility given prevailing prices.


$$E(p_x,p_y,U_0)=min(p_xx+p_yy) \text{ s.t. } U(x,y) \geq U_0$$

*Min* and not *argmin* ... the expenditure amount

\

Hicksian (compensated) Demand for X: The amount of X I consume in a 'minimising expenditure' bundle that yields some level of utility ($U_0$)

\

With two goods, x and y, the Hicksian demand for x is the first, 'x' element of the below ('Hicksian demand vector x,y')

$$h_{x,y}(p_x,p_y,U_0)=arg\min_{x,y} (p_xx+p_yy) \text{ s.t. } U(x,y) \geq U_0$$



*Note:*
These functions are actually used in 'structural' estimates of demand used in merger analysis, pricing, litigation consulting, etc.

\
These are 'inverses' of one another.

This is  because 'Maximise utility s.t. a budget constraint' is sort of equivalent to 'minimise expenditure s.t. attaining a particular level of utility'


<br> <br> \bigskip

### Expenditure and Indirect utility identities {-}

Look:


$$V\Big(p_x,p_y,E(p_x,p_y,U_0)\Big)=U_0$$


'My utility when I have enough income (expenditure) to give me utility $U_0$ ... is $U_0$'


<br> <br> \bigskip


*And*

$$E\Big(p_x,p_y,V(p_x,p_y,I_0)\Big)=I_0$$


'The amount I need to spend to get the utility I can achieve with income $I_0$ is $I_0$'



### Hicksian (compensated) and Marshallian (regular) identities {-#hicksian}


$$h_x(p_x,p_y,U_0)=d_x(p_x,p_y,E(p_x,p_y,U_0))$$


'The amount of X I consume that yields $U_0$ at the lowest cost...

is the amount of X I would consume if I had the income that allowed me to get utility $U_0$.'


<br> <br> \bigskip


Totally differentiating these equalities allows us to relate the compensated and uncompensated *responses* to price changes.

\


The proof of Roy's identity is rather involved and uses the envelope theorem. However, I always thought I saw some intuition for it, if we rearrange it.

```{block2,  type='technote'}

What is the [Envelope theorem](https://mjo.osborne.economics.utoronto.ca/index.php/tutorial/index/1/mee/t)?


```


\

How much does utility decrease when good X becomes more expensive by $\epsilon$, i.e., what is $\frac{\partial V}{\partial p_x}$?

Well, from our initial consumption point we now lose  $d_X \times \epsilon$ in spending power. The marginal deteriment of that to our utility is the same as if we had lost this in income, which hurts us at rate $\frac{\partial V}{\partial I}$.

But why is it OK to consider this 'from the initial consumption point' and not also consider the adjustment to this? I believe that comes from the Envelope theorem.

<br> <br> \bigskip

Intuition for Sheppard's Lemma is easier.  How much more do we need to spend to get the same utility if $p_x$ rises?

We must spend, at the margin, at a rate equal to our previous consumption of $x$, $h_x$. Again, we don't need to consider the adjustment to the consumption bundle in answering this *particular* question because of the envelope theorem.


## Intuition from the 'Slutsky equation'


$$\frac{\partial d_x}{\partial p_x}= \frac{\partial h_x}{\partial p_x} - \frac{\partial d_x}{\partial I}x$$


<br> <br> \bigskip


At the margin, the change in demand for X in response to a change in its price sums:

- The compensated change in demand (the first term); the marginal substitution effect
- the income effect multiplied by the amount of X consumed
    - because a price increase in X reduces 'remaining income' proportionally to how much X is consumed

<br> <br> \bigskip

A similar result applies to a change in *another* good's price, with similar intuition


## Supplement: options contracts {#options-sup}



<div class="marginnote">
The content in this section is largely drawn from Nicholson and Snyder, "Intermediate Microeconomics and Its Application", 2010, Cengage.
</div>
 

Option contract

:     Financial contract offering the right (but not the obligation) to buy or sell an asset over a specified period (at a certain price).


<br> 

Attributes of options:

1. Specification of transaction: what is bought/sold, how many units maximum, at what price, etc
2. Period the option may be exercised (from when until when)
3. Price of the option

\

### Price of options determined by {-}

1. Expected value of underlying transaction (e.g., for a call option, expected future share price minus strike price)

2. Variability of the value of the transaction

Option G (a 'call option'): Right to buy Google share at £500 (£500 'strike price') in December 2020

- Worth more the higher the current share price

- If $P_{google}< £500$ currently, then option G is worth more the higher the expected *variability* in $P_{google}$
    - Variability can only help the option-holder:
    - price increase helps her
    - if price falls below £ 500, she doesn't need to exercise the option

```{block2,  type='warning'}

If you didn't read this you probably would have guessed the opposite. Common sense does not get you everywhere, and definitely not a good mark on exams. I *particularly* want you to understand those results that are *not* common sense.

```  


3. Duration: the longer the better -- a longer duration brings a greater chance that the price will rise above strike price (£500)

Note that the results for 'right to sell = call options' are similar, just replace the words 'buy' with 'sell' and reverse the directions ('rise' with 'fall), etc.


\

```{block2,  type='note'}

Classic economist's argument: you should 'bet against yourself' to minimise risk; but this might give you bad incentives to perform. See column about this [HERE](http://www.marketplace.org/2008/08/11/business/hedging-your-bets-hard-times) ... "Hedging your bets in hard times"]

* Market failures: Asymmetric information** (Moral hazard, adverse selection, signaling)


Broadly, asymmetric information is a situation in which one party to a transaction has more information than the other party.


<!-- See separate notes on VLE -->

Brief summary below


## Principal-Agent Problem {#pa-problem}

A principal “hires” an agent to perform some task, and the agent has private information, either about her actions or her type.

- Employer-employee relationship:

- Employer (principal); employee (agent)

- A worker has full information about whether she is working hard (action) or her job skills (type).

- How does an employer monitor/influence effort?  How does a potential employee signal their high-quality or low-quality type?

\

**Moral hazard** problem occurs when an agent’s action is private information

- Offering incentives may be costly (because of limited liability, risk aversion, and difficulties in writing contracts)

**Hidden information** ('privacy') problem occurs when an agent’s type is private information.

- 'Lemons problem' $\rightarrow$ potential **Adverse selection** and/or closing down of markets

- Principal/agent $\rightarrow$ 'distorted' output or quality for 'less favored' type to reduce 'information rent' for 'better' type

<div class="marginnote">
Also, if the Agent moves first (instead of the Principal), this can lead to a 'signaling game', which we will not cover here. See 'the signaling benefit of education.
</div>


\

Automobile insurance

- When selling a policy the company does not know whether you are a high risk or low risk driver (adverse selection)

- Since you are insured you are less careful (moral hazard)

## Moral hazard: Basic principles

1. If 'effort' (or honesty) is unobserved or un-enforceable, principal (P) must offer incentives based on *observed performance* or *output* of the agent.

2. If output has (uncontrollable) *random component*, rewarding output shifts risk to the *agent* (A).

- If A is more risk-averse than P, if compensation must be tied to output $\rightarrow$ inefficient risk-bearing.

- Because of the cost of paying a 'risk premium' to A $\rightarrow$ P may demand less effort than is efficient

3. Otherwise, if P \& A have the same risk-attitude, P can 'sell the profits to A' $\rightarrow$ efficiency

- But not if A has 'limited liability' $\rightarrow$ inefficiency:
    - P can only 'reward' A not 'punish' her $\rightarrow$ costly $\rightarrow$ demand less effort

*See 'more formal moral hazard notes' (VLE) and Flowchart if interested*


## Lemons problem

*Where sellers know more about the value of used cars than buyers, some sales that would be mutually beneficial will not take place.*


Easiest model:

- Car quality $x$ distributed $x \sim U(0,1)$.

- Buyer values at $\frac{3}{2}x$, seller values it at $x$ (so efficiency requires trade!)

- Seller proposes 'tioli' price $p$


$\rightarrow$ Seller must choose $p \geq x$ $\rightarrow E(x|p)=\frac{1}{2}x$ $\rightarrow$ Buyer anticipates value $\frac{3}{2}\frac{1}{2}p=\frac{3}{4}p$

Buyer never accepts any price $\rightarrow$ market closes down

### Introduction: Adverse Selection (Hidden information) and screening

This involves the optimal design of incentives when the agent has
private information on an *unchosen* variable that affects the payoffs.

However, the identical model describes second-degree price discrimination, setting a menu of prices and quantities/qualities and getting consumers to self select.

 Firm hires employee of unknown skill or unknown intrinsic
motivation 

 A landlord delegates the cultivation of land with unknown
productivity to a tenant-farmer

... but, where there is *hidden information*, this conflicts with the
incentive compatibility constraints of the agent 

\

... the principal may set a separate contract for each type, and hopes
they will ‘self-select’ (this is called *screening*)...


\

This leads to a second best set of contracts that reduces allocative
efficiency to minimize the *information rents* paid to agents.

**Example [“Listen to the market, hear the best policy decision, but don’t always choose it” by Reinstein and Song (2019)](https://ore.exeter.ac.uk/repository/handle/10871/36180)**

```{block2,  type='fold'}


**Abstract:**
  
Policymakers often consider policies with (a) uncertain social benefits and (b) uncertain impacts on the value of private assets; we characterize six ways (a) and (b) may be inter-related. Where investors have private information over (b), policymakers may attempt to learn this through the response of asset markets to proposed policies. However, where this information is concentrated, an informed trader may profitably hide his information and “manipulate” the market. We show that it is nonetheless generically optimal for policymakers to listen and respond to asset markets, but under specified conditions they must commit (e.g., through “political capital”) to sometimes pursuing a policy even when the expected welfare effects are negative. Surprisingly, allowing traders to short-sell can make it easier for policymakers to induce truth-telling actions.

### A Basic parametric model (two types)

Principal delegates production to agent:
$q$ units.

U(Principal)= $S(q)$

Where $S(0)=0$ , 
$S^{\prime }(0)>\bar{\theta}>0$ , and 
$S^{\prime \prime }(.)<0$ 

\

Fixed cost $F$ (which can basically be ignored)

Marginal cost $\theta\in\{\underline{\theta},\bar{\theta}\}$

, where
$\underline{\theta}<\bar{\theta}$ .

U(agent) $ = t - \theta q$ 

(This is just her payment, net of costs).

Total cost of production of $q$ units is given
by

$$ C(q,\theta)  =F+\theta q$$
$$\theta  \in\{\bar{\theta},\underline{\theta}\}$$

<div class="marginnote">

Note that these are steeper for the higher cost agent as producing more
is more costly for her.


#### A Contract {-}

P offers a “take it or leave it” (TIOLI) contract to A

Contract: a quantity $q$ and a payment $t$ corresponding to each
quantity.


### Full information/first-best case

#### Principal’s objective; full information case {-}

$$\begin{aligned}
\max E(\Pi )=\Pi =\max_{q_{lc},q_{hc}}E(S(q)-t(q)) \\
\\
\text{s.t. } t_{lc}-\underline{\theta } q_{lc} \geq 0 \:\:\:\:\:\:\:\: [PC_{FB,lc}]\\
\text{and } \\
t_{hc}-\bar{\theta} q_{hc} \geq 0 \:\:\:\:\:\:\:\: [PC_{FB,hc}]\\
\\
\text{for }\theta  \in \{\underline{\theta },\bar{\theta}\}\text{, }q\in
\{q_{lc},q_{hc}\}
\end{aligned}$$


Participation constraint only; separate contract to each type – no need for self-selection because $P$ can discriminate (assuming this is legally possible!).

\

#### Considerations {-}

Must induce (each type of) $A$ to accept contract

No reason to overcompensate $A$ $\Longrightarrow$ Constraint binds
$\Longrightarrow $

$t = \theta q$ $\Longrightarrow$ Maximize $S(q)-\theta q$

$\Longrightarrow q^{FB}(\theta)$ solves $S^{\prime }(q^{FB})=\theta$ for
each type, (from strict concavity of $S$)

#### Optimal first-best contracts {-}

$\Longrightarrow$ Optimal contracts $C^{FB}=\{q^{FB}(\theta)$,
$t=F+q^{FB}(\theta)\times\theta \}$; for
$\theta \in \{\underline{\theta }$, $\bar{\theta}\}$.

In other words $t_{lc}=F+q^{FB}_{lc}\underline{\theta}$ and
$q_{lc}=q^{FB}_{lc}$

and $t_{hc}=F+q^{FB}_{hc}\bar{\theta}$ and $q_{hc}=q^{FB}_{hc}$

<!--
![image](picsfigs/lm_2-3_firstbest.png)
-->


### *Incomplete* information contracts 

*Principal’s beliefs*: type $\underline{\theta }$ with probability $v$,
type $\bar{\theta}$ with probability $1-v$.

$P$ offers contracts
$\mathbf{C}^{SB}=\{(q_{lc},t_{lc}),(q_{hc},t_{hc})\}$

Each contract is implicitly supposed to attract a particular type of
agent (self-selection).

\


#### Cannot achieve first-best (not at the same cost) {-}

$\mathbf{C}^{FB}$ cannot be implemented here.

\

*Sketch of proof*: Under $\mathbf{C}^{FB}$, both types of agent will strictly
prefer to accept the contract $\{q_{hc}^{FB},t_{hc}=F+q_{hc}^{FB}\bar{\theta}\}$. 

This is not optimal for the principal if agent is of type $\underline{\theta}$.

\

Note: $q_{hc}^{FB}\bar{\theta}-q_{hc}^{FB}\underline{\theta }=(\bar{\theta}-\underline{\theta })q_{hc}^{FB}>0$, so low-cost type’s IC constraint not met at $\mathbf{C}^{FB}$.

\

#### IC and PC Constraints {-}

A set of contracts $\{(q_{lc},t_{lc}),(q_{hc},t_{hc})\}$
is incentive compatible for type
$\underline{\theta}$ if:

$$t_{lc}-\underline{\theta }q_{lc}\geq t_{hc}-\underline{\theta }q_{hc}
\tag{IC(\underline{$\theta $})}$$

Similarly, a set of contracts
$\{(q_{lc},t_{lc}),(q_{hc},t_{hc})$ is incentive compatible
for type $\bar{\theta}$ if:

$$t_{hc}-\bar{\theta}q_{hc}\geq t_{lc}-\bar{\theta}q_{lc}
\tag{IC($\bar{\theta}$)}  \label{IC2}$$

\ 

Thus ... 

The corresponding participation constraints are simply that the
contracts yield non-negative utility (reservation wage assumed to be
$0$):

$$t_{lc}-\underline{\theta }q_{lc}\geq 0 \tag{PC($\underline{\theta }$)}$$

$$t_{hc}-\bar{\theta}q_{hc}\geq 0  \tag{PC($\bar{\theta}$)}$$

#### Important Special Cases

Bunching/pooling: Single contract for both types. Incentive
constraints trivially satisfied, and the PC of the $\underline{\theta }$
type is weaker than for the $\bar{\theta}$ type. So we only need to
check one constraint for this type of contract.

Shut Down: A $\{0,0\}$ contract for high type and a regular
contract for the low cost type. This implicitly involves a shut down of
the high cost type.

Low cost type will produce at least as much.

Adding up IC($\underline{\theta }$) and
IC($\bar{\theta}$):

$$\begin{aligned}
(t_{hc}+t_{lc})-\bar{\theta}q_{hc}-\underline{\theta }q_{lc} &\geq
&(t_{hc}+t_{lc})-\bar{\theta}q_{lc}-\underline{\theta }q_{hc}
\\
-\underline{\theta }q_{lc}+\bar{\theta}q_{lc} &\geq &-\underline{\theta }q_{hc}+\bar{\theta}q_{hc} \\
(\bar{\theta}-\underline{\theta })q_{lc} &\geq &(\bar{\theta}-\underline{\theta })q_{hc} \\
q_{lc} &\geq &q_{hc}\end{aligned}$$

#### Information rents {-}

The low-cost type must receive a positive surplus – an information rent’
(in an interior, separating contract)
\

**Proof**

Sketch: The low-cost type can always mimic the high-cost type and
earn a surplus ($\Delta \theta q_{hc}$ below) – we need to give her at
least this in order to 'be herself'.

$q_{hc},q_{lc}>0$

$\mathbf{\Longrightarrow }u(\bar{\theta},q_{hc})=t_{hc}-\bar{\theta}q_{hc}\geq 0$ needed
to satisfy the high-cost type’s PC

$\Longrightarrow$

\

If low type accepts this (‘lies’), she gets

$$\begin{aligned}
u(\underline{\theta },q_{hc}) &=&t_{hc}-\underline{\theta }q_{hc}=\text{ }t_{hc}-\bar{\theta}q_{hc}+\Delta \theta q_{hc} \\
 &=&u(\bar{\theta},q_{hc})+\Delta \theta q_{hc}>0 \\
\text{Where } \ \ \ \Delta \theta &\equiv &\bar{\theta}-\underline{\theta }\end{aligned}$$

Thus a positive surplus is needed to prevent ‘mimicry,’ i.e.,
$u(\underline{\theta },q_{lc})\geq u(\underline{\theta },q_{hc})>0$

\

#### If P wanted to implement ‘first-best outputs...’ {-}



<div class="marginnote">
Image source: Laffont and Martimort
</div>

![image](picsfigs/lm_fig_2_4.png)

... it costs more than with full-info; indifference curve goes through
’C’ & B\* $\rightarrow$ rent $\Delta \theta \bar{q}^{\ast}$.

\

#### P’s Optimization Problem (interior, separating) {-}

$$\begin{aligned}
&&\max_{q_{hc},t_{hc},q_{lc},t_{lc}}v[S(q_{lc})-t_{lc}]+(1-v)[S(q_{hc})-t_{hc}]
\\
&&s.t.\text{ }IC(\underline{\theta })\text{, }IC(\bar{\theta})\text{, }PC(\underline{\theta })\text{, and }PC(\bar{\theta})\end{aligned}$$

I.e. (writing this in terms of the net utilities of the
agents) $u_{lc}$ and $u_{hc}$)
$$\max_{(q_{lc},t_{lc}),(q_{hc},t_{hc})}v[S(q_{lc})-\underline{\theta }q_{lc}]+(1-v)[S(q_{hc})-\bar{\theta}q_{hc}]-[vu_{lc}+(1-v)u_{hc}]
\notag$$

Subject to

$$\begin{aligned}
u_{lc} &\geq &u_{hc}+\Delta \theta q_{hc} \\
u_{hc} &\geq &u_{lc}-\Delta \theta q_{lc} \\
u_{lc} &\geq &0 \\
u_{hc} &\geq &0\end{aligned}$$


$$\begin{aligned}
PC(\underline{\theta }) &:&t_{lc}-\underline{\theta }q_{lc}\equiv u_{lc}\geq 0 \\
PC(\bar{\theta}) &:&t_{hc}-\bar{\theta}q_{hc}\equiv u_{hc}\geq 0 \\
IC\underline{(\theta )} &\text{:}&t_{lc}-\underline{\theta }q_{lc}\geq
t_{hc}-\underline{\theta }q_{hc}\text{; } \\
&\mathbf{\Longrightarrow }&u_{lc}\geq u_{hc}+\Delta \theta q_{hc} \\
IC(\bar{\theta}) &:&t_{hc}-\bar{\theta}q_{hc}\geq t_{lc}-\bar{\theta}q_{lc}
\\
&\mathbf{\Longrightarrow }&\text{ }u_{hc}\geq u_{lc}-\Delta \theta
q_{lc}\end{aligned}$$

\

#### Which constraints *do* bind? {-}

...We can thus ‘substitute them in’, and simplify the problem.


$PC(\bar{\theta})$ is a binding constraint

Proof (by contradiction): 

```{block2,  type='fold'}


Suppose we have a contract meeting all the constraints, where
 $u_{hc}>0$ . Then  $P$  could lower  $u_{hc}$ by $\varepsilon$, increase $P$ ’s expected surplus, and the high-cost type would still participate.

$PC(\underline{\theta })$ doesn’t bind (information rent).

$P$ could also lower $u_{lc}$ by the same
$\varepsilon$
  
```

\

**$IC(\underline{\theta })$ and $IC(\bar{\theta})$.** 

$IC(\underline{\theta })$ is a binding constraint

Proof (by contradiction): 

```{block2,  type='fold'}

If not, i.e.,
if $u_{lc}>u_{hc}+\Delta \theta q_{hc}$, $P$ could lower $u_{lc}$, doing better and still satisfying the relevant constraints:

$IC(\underline{\theta })$ would continue to hold if it didn’t bind
before.

$IC(\bar{\theta})$ is *relaxed* (*less* incentive for high-cost
type to ‘fake it’).

$PC(\underline{\theta })$ would continue to hold because it didn’t
bind before– remember we showed an ‘information rent.’

$PC(\bar{\theta})$  is unaffected.
```

\

*Thus we know $PC(\bar{\theta})$ and $IC(\underline{\theta})$ bind,*

$\Longrightarrow$Any optimal contract must have $u_{hc}=0$, i.e., $t_{hc}-\bar{\theta}q_{hc}=0~$ $\mathbf{\Longrightarrow }t_{hc}=\bar{\theta}q_{hc}$

\

and $u_{lc}=u_{hc}+\Delta \theta q_{hc}$, 

i.e., $t_{lc}-\underline{\theta }q_{lc}=0+\Delta \theta q_{hc}$

$\mathbf{\Longrightarrow }t_{lc}=\underline{\theta }q_{lc}+\Delta
\theta q_{hc}$

#### Which constraints *do not* bind? {-}

$PC(\underline{\theta})$ does not bind (information rent) – so we
can ignore it.  

$IC(\bar{\theta})$ is redundant: $$IC(\bar{\theta}): u_{hc}\geq u_{lc}-\Delta \theta q_{lc}$$



```{block2,  type='fold'}

$$\begin{aligned}
u_{hc}  = t_{hc}-\bar{\theta}q_{hc}=0\text{ {since} }PC(\bar{\theta}) \text{ {  binds.}} \\
\text{{  Recalling }} $u_{lc}=u_{hc}+\Delta \theta q_{hc}$ \text{{  we have}} \\
\u_{lc}-\Delta \theta q_{lc}  = u_{hc}+\Delta \theta q_{hc}-\Delta \theta q_{lc} \\
 u_{lc}-\Delta \theta q_{lc}  = u_{hc}+\Delta \theta (q_{hc}-q_{lc}) \\
= 0+\Delta \theta (q_{hc}-q_{lc})\leq 0 \\
\text{{  since }}q_{hc}  \leq  q_{lc}\text{ {  (shown earlier)}} \\
  \mathbf{\Longrightarrow } u_{hc}\geq u_{lc}-\Delta \theta q_{lc}
\end{aligned}$$

So $IC(\bar{\theta})$ holds as a result of the other
constraints, it is redundant. 

If $q_{hc}<q_{lc}$, which we will see later, then
 $u_{hc}>u_{lc}-\Delta \theta q_{lc}$, $IC(\bar{\theta})$
does not ‘bind.’

```

\

**Solving...**

$\Longrightarrow$ Optimization problem:

$$\begin{aligned}
&&\max_{q_{lc},q_{hc}}E(\Pi ) \\
&=&\max_{q_{lc},q_{hc}}E(S(q)-t(q)) \\
&=&\max_{q_{lc},q_{hc}}v\times \lbrack
S(q_{lc})-t_{lc}]+(1-v)[S(q_{hc})-t_{hc}]\text{ } \\
&&\text{{  s.t. PC & IC constraints}}\end{aligned}$$

$$\max_{q_{lc},q_{hc}}v[S(q_{lc})-\underline{\theta }\underline{q}-\Delta
\theta q_{hc}]+(1-v)[S(q_{hc})-\bar{\theta}q_{hc}]$$

$$\max_{q_{lc},q_{hc}}\Pi =\max_{q_{lc},q_{hc}}~v\times \lbrack S(q_{lc})-\underline{\theta }q_{lc}-\Delta \theta q_{hc}]+(1-v)[S(q_{hc})-\bar{\theta}q_{hc}]$$

Given that this is a concave problem, and assuming that the optimum is interior, the first order conditions are necessary and sufficient for the optimum:

$$\begin{aligned}
\frac{\partial \Pi }{\partial q_{lc}} &=&v\times \lbrack S^{\prime }(q_{lc})-\underline{\theta }]=0 \\
 &\mathbf{\Longrightarrow }&S^{\prime }(q_{lc}^{SB})=\underline{\theta } \\
 &\mathbf{\Longrightarrow }&q_{lc}^{SB}=q_{lc}^{\ast }\text{...}\mathbf{\Longrightarrow }\text{{  'efficient lc output'}}\end{aligned}$$

\

#### High-cost type’s output distorted downwards {-}

$$\begin{aligned}
\frac{\partial \Pi }{\partial q_{hc}} &=&(1-v)[S^{\prime }(q_{hc}^{SB})-\bar{\theta}]-v\Delta \theta =0 \\
 S^{\prime }(q_{hc}^{SB}) &=&\bar{\theta}+\frac{v}{(1-v)}\Delta \theta
\text{ ...}\mathbf{\Longrightarrow }q_{hc}^{SB}<q_{hc}^{\ast }\end{aligned}$$

The optimal second-best contract thus offers the low cost type the first best quantity while it distorts the quantity of the high cost agent downward to minimize information rents. 

This distortion increases in $\frac{v}{(1-v)}$---the odds of a low-cost type – and in $\Delta\theta$---the cost difference. 

This also implies $q_{hc}^{SB}<q_{hc}^{\ast }<q_{lc}^{\ast }=q_{lc}^{SB}$ as claimed before, so
$IC(\bar{\theta})$ holds with inequality.

\

#### But is it worth doing? {-}

Profit:

$$E[\Pi ^{SB}]=v[S(q_{lc}^{\ast })-\underline{\theta }q_{lc}^{\ast }-\Delta
\theta q_{hc}^{\ast }]+(1-v)[S(q_{hc}^{SB})-\bar{\theta}q_{hc}^{SB}]$$

There is a cost to inducing $q_{hc}^{SB}$and
$q_{lc}^{SB}>q_{hc}^{SB}$.

- Fixed (we ignore here)and marginal costs of output 

- Information rents to low-cost type ($\Delta \theta
q_{hc}^{SB} $)

- (Other un-modeled costs, e.g., menu costs, psychological
factors)

\


#### Alternative I – Bunching/pooling: {-}

Maximize s.t. $PC(\bar{\theta})$ only, which binds.


$\Longrightarrow t^{pool}-\bar{\theta}q\equiv u_{hc}^{pool}=0$

$\mathbf{\Longrightarrow}t^{pool}=\bar{\theta}q$

(Class question: why?)

#### Solving pooling case {-}

$$\begin{aligned}
E[\Pi ^{Pool}] &=&S(q^{Pool})-t^{pool}=S(q^{Pool})-\bar{\theta}q^{pool} \\
q^{pool} &=&\max_{q}S(q)-\bar{\theta}q \\
&\mathbf{\Longrightarrow }&S^{\prime }(q^{Pool})=\bar{\theta} \\
&\mathbf{\Longrightarrow }&q^{pool}=q_{hc}^{\ast } \\
&\mathbf{\Longrightarrow }&t^{pool}=\bar{\theta}q_{hc}^{\ast } \\
&\mathbf{\Longrightarrow }&E[\Pi ^{pool}]=S(q_{hc}^{\ast })-\bar{\theta}q_{hc}^{\ast } \\
u_{lc} &=&\Delta \bar{\theta}q_{hc}^{\ast }\end{aligned}$$

#### Optimal pooling strategy {-}

The optimal pooling strategy has both agents producing at the
level that is technically efficient for the high-cost type. 

The high cost type will get no surplus, but the low-cost type gets
a rent $\Delta \bar{\theta}q_{hc}^{\ast }$.

$\Delta \bar{\theta}q_{hc}^{\ast }$ versus $\Delta \theta
q_{hc}^{SB}$)!

\

#### Alternative II – ‘Shut down’ high-cost type (or both types) {-}

<div class="marginnote">
This resembles the classic “screening” contract; greater reward for higher effort means the average level of those who will accept the contract is higher! ... See 156-159 in Milgrom and Roberts 
</div>
 

Maximize s.t. $PC(\underline{\theta })$ only, which binds. At this contract the high-cost type will not want to participate. 

$\Longrightarrow t^{shut}-\underline{\theta}q^{shut}\equiv u_{lc}^{shut}=0$

$\mathbf{\Longrightarrow}t^{shut}=\underline{\theta}q^{shut}$

$$\begin{aligned}
E[\Pi ^{shut}]  = v\times \left( S(q^{shut})-t^{shut}\right) =v\times \left(
S(q^{shut})-\underline{\theta }q^{shut}\right) \\
 q^{shut}  = \max_{q}v\times \left( S(q)-\underline{\theta }q\right)
\notag \\
  \mathbf{\Longrightarrow } S^{\prime }(q^{shut})=\underline{\theta }
\notag \\
  \mathbf{\Longrightarrow } q^{shut}=q_{lc}^{\ast }  \notag \\
  \mathbf{\Longrightarrow } t^{shut}=\underline{\theta }q_{lc}^{\ast }
\notag \\
  \mathbf{\Longrightarrow } E[\Pi ^{shut}]=v\times \left(
S(q_{lc}^{\ast })-\underline{\theta }q_{lc}^{\ast }\right)  \notag\end{aligned}$$

$P$ will get her to produce at her technically efficient level,
and $P$ will take all the rent.

#### Caveat: shut-down implied by a negative solution to the previous problem! {-}

Remember the FOC for the high-cost type’s ‘SB’ output:

$$S^{\prime }(q_{hc}^{SB})=\bar{\theta}+[\frac{v}{(1-v)}\Delta \theta \text{ }]$$

\

But if the latter effect is large enough, this may have no
positive solution.  The first unit of the high-cost type’s output may be
too costly in net. 

$q_{hc}^{SB}=0$ would be optimal, ‘shutting down’ the high-cost
type.

$q_{hc}^{SB}=0$ will also imply no rent for the low-cost type
(remember, the rent was $\Delta \theta q_{hc}$).

*Thus the ‘shut down’ strategy need not be checked separately in the
continuous differentiable concave case (unless you are asked to do
so).*

\

#### Comparing alternatives – Interior-separating, pooling, shut-down one, shut down all {-}

$$\begin{aligned}
E[\Pi ^{SB}]  = v[S(q_{lc}^{\ast })-\underline{\theta }q_{lc}^{\ast }-\Delta
\theta q_{hc}^{\ast }]+(1-v)[S(q_{hc}^{SB})-\bar{\theta}q_{hc}^{SB}] \\
E[\Pi ^{Pool}]  = S(q_{hc}^{\ast })-\bar{\theta}q_{hc}^{\ast } \\
E[\Pi ^{shut}]  = v\left( S(q_{lc}^{\ast })-\underline{\theta }q_{lc}^{\ast
}\right) \\
E[\Pi ^{shut~all}]  = 0\end{aligned}$$

\

In general, all of these possibilities should be compared.

In a very general case (although not given the assumptions here),
any of the four could be the optimal one. 

<div class="marginnote">
Note, the ‘shut all’ is not optimal given our assumptions above unless we add a fixed cost
$F$ to all the other alternative policies, or have positive
reservation wages; Pooling also will not be optimal here, although it
can if we allow different functional assumptions; see below.\]
</div>
 
Note: These comparisons will be easier to make in a parametric or
numerical case.

\

For example, for $P$ to prefer to have
both types of agent produce different positive output over only having
the low-cost type produce, we require: 

$$\begin{aligned}
E[\Pi ^{SB}]  > E[\Pi ^{shut}]\Longleftrightarrow \\
v[S(q_{lc}^{\ast })-\underline{\theta }q_{lc}^{\ast }-\Delta \theta
q_{hc}^{\ast }]+(1-v)[S(q_{hc}^{SB})-\bar{\theta}q_{hc}^{SB}]  >  \\
v\left( S(q_{lc}^{\ast })-\underline{\theta }q_{lc}^{\ast }\right)
 \Longleftrightarrow   \\
(1-v)[S(q_{hc}^{SB})-\bar{\theta}q_{hc}^{SB}]  > v\Delta \theta q_{hc}^{\ast
}\end{aligned}$$

I.e., the expected benefit of the high-cost type’s output must
exceed the resulting information rent paid to the low-cost type.

\

$$(1-v)[S(q_{hc}^{SB})-\bar{\theta}q_{hc}^{SB}]>v\Delta \theta q_{hc}^{\ast }$$

The relative advantage of writing a contract that only the low-cost type will sign increases as:

The difference in costs increases.

Low-cost types become more likely.

The value of additional output decreases.

Comparing the pooling and shutting-down possibilities:

$$\begin{aligned}
E[\Pi ^{shut}]  > E[\Pi ^{Pool}] \\
 \Longleftrightarrow  v\left( S(q_{lc}^{\ast })-\underline{\theta }q_{lc}^{\ast }\right) >\left( S(q_{hc}^{\ast })-\bar{\theta}q_{hc}^{\ast
}\right)\end{aligned}$$

The ‘net value’ generated by a low-cost type (weighted by the
probability that a low-cost type is drawn) must exceed the ‘net value’
generated by a high cost type.

$$\begin{aligned}
E[\Pi ^{SB}]  > E[\Pi ^{pool}] \\
v[S(q_{lc}^{\ast })-\underline{\theta }q_{lc}^{\ast }-\Delta \theta
q_{hc}^{\ast }]+(1-v)[S(q_{hc}^{SB})-\bar{\theta}q_{hc}^{SB}]
 > S(q_{hc}^{\ast })-\bar{\theta}q_{hc}^{\ast }\end{aligned}$$

$P$ pays a rent to the low-cost type (a larger rent than in the
pooling case), and gets less production from the high-cost type
(‘distortion’). However, $P$ gets a higher output from the
low-cost type under the ‘SB’ contract than under the pooling
contract.

It appears unclear which contract $P$ prefers. It
will depend on the probability of a low-cost type, the relative costs of
the two types, and the value of additional output (the
$S(\cdot )$ function). BUT with the conditions as given, we
know pooling on a positive output will never be optimal! (see below)

#### Proof of no pooling {-}

**Proof by contradiction**

We compared
$v[S(q_{lc}^{\ast })-\underline{\theta }q_{lc}^{\ast }-\Delta \theta q_{hc}^{\ast }]+(1-v)[S(q_{hc}^{SB})-\bar{\theta}q_{hc}^{SB}]$ and
$S(q_{hc}^{\ast })-\bar{\theta}q_{hc}^{\ast }$, a messy
comparison. But, we need only show that the pooling contract can never
be optimal, i.e.., show that if P is ‘pooling on positive output,’ then
he could do better.

\

$E[\Pi
^{pool}]=S(q_{hc}^{\ast })-\bar{\theta}q_{hc}^{\ast }$. But to
this single contract
$\{q_{hc}^{\ast },\bar{\theta}q_{hc}^{\ast }\}$, P could
introduce a second contract $q_{lc}=q_{hc}^{\ast
}+\varepsilon $ and reward anyone who takes it an additional
$\underline{\theta }\varepsilon $.  By convention, the
low-cost type will take this contract (because she is indifferent and P
wants her to, as we will see), . Thus, P is better off
doing so (note, payoffs will only vary when a low-cost type arises) as
long as $s(q_{hc}^{\ast
}+\varepsilon)-s(q_{hc}^{\ast})>\underline{\theta}\varepsilon$  for
some small $\varepsilon $, i.e., as long as
$s^{\prime }(q_{hc}^{\ast })>\underline{\theta }$(as long
as $s^{\prime }$ is continuous, as assumed).  

$s^{\prime }(q_{hc}^{\ast })=\bar{\theta}>\underline{\theta }$.
Hence, $s^{\prime }(q_{hc}^{\ast })>\underline{\theta }$,
and the principal can improve on a pooling contract.

\

*However*, pooling may be optimal under other functional
assumptions, e.g., if there is a ‘menu cost’ to adding an item on the
contract.

\

### Overall results (Important!)

$$t_{lc}=\underline{\theta }q_{lc}+\Delta \theta q_{hc};\;\;\;t_{hc}=\bar{\theta}q_{hc}.$$

The efficient type gets a positive information rent, given by
$u_{lc}=\Delta \theta q_{hc}$

 Output distortion of inefficient type:

$$S^{\prime }(q_{hc})=\bar{\theta}+\frac{v}{1-v}\Delta \theta.$$

$q_{lc}=q_{lc}^{FB}$

\

Thus under asymmetric information, the optimal menu of contracts entails:

1. No output distortion of the low cost type, thus
$q_{lc}=q_{lc}^{FB}$

2. Downward output distortion of inefficient type: 

$$S^{\prime }(q_{hc})=\bar{\theta}+\frac{v}{1-v}\Delta \theta .$$

‘by making the high-cost agent produce less, and paying him less,
we make his target output less attractive to the low cost agent’

\

3. Only efficient type gets a positive information rent, given
by $u_{lc}=\Delta \theta q_{hc}$.

4. Second best transfers are given by 

$$t_{lc}=\underline{\theta }q_{lc}+\Delta \theta q_{hc};\;\;\;t_{hc}=\bar{\theta}q_{hc}.$$

#### Remember: {-}

-   Differences from moral hazard

-   Which agent’s PC constraint binds, and why?

-   Which agent’s IC constraint binds, and why?

-   Which quantity is “distorted” ?

-   What is an “information rent” and who will get one?

-   When does the principal want to meet these constraints (interior,
    separating equilibrium)?
