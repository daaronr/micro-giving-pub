### Learning goals {-}

1. What are monopolies and what are barriers to entry?

2. How do monopolies choose prices and quantities?

3. What are the social (welfare) consequences of monopoly?

\

4. What is 'price discrimination'?

5. What forms can price discrimination take, and how does it increase a monopoly's profits?

6. How does price discrimination affect social welfare, and whom does it help or hurt?

7. (Very briefly: other forms of imperfect competition)

\


*Recall*: under perfect competition

- free entry and exit
    - $\rightarrow$ zero long-run economic profit

- many many tiny firms
    - $\rightarrow$ firms are price takers

- $\rightarrow$ p=mc
    - And in the long run $p=ATC$ and firms produce at $min(AC)$


<br> <br> \bigskip

\

*these are extreme assumptions; perhaps only a theoretical ideal*

\


<br> <br> \bigskip


- (Firms with market power might set $p>mc$)

```{block2,  type='digression'}
There are a variety of *market structures* we might consider that fall in between the extremes of perfect competition and monopoly. These include 'oligopoly' and 'monopolistic competition'. The field of Industrial Organization focuses on these ,odels of market structure  and their implications for pricing, welfare, innovation, and more
```

\

**The opposite extreme is a monopoly:**^

- A single firm

- Barriers to entry $\rightarrow$ No threat of entry

- The monopoly can choose it's price, which becomes the 'market price'

\

Still, the more it charges the fewer units demanded. Thus, it chooses a price (or quantity) where MR=MC (like all firms do)

- Produces 'less than socially optimal quantity' in order to charge a high price and increase its profit
\


## Barriers to entry


### Technical barriers to entry {-}
- IRS/ Diminishing average cost over a broad range of output
    - $\rightarrow$ 'a natural monopoly'
    - (Here multiple firms producing separately are *less efficient*, cannot produce the lowest cost)
- Special knowledge of a low-cost method of production, or key resource

\

### Legal barriers to entry. {-}

- Patents and copyrights
- Exclusive franchise or license (granted by government, by another firm, by a university)
- Government support for a dominant firm, discouraging/forbidding others

\

... from the 2016 Massachusetts ballot initiative:


```{r  fig.cap = '', out.width='40%', fig.asp=.4, fig.align='center',  echo = FALSE}
 knitr::include_graphics("picsfigs/gaming_open.png")
```



## Monopoly profit-maximisation

- As always, set Q to maximize $QP(Q)-C(Q)$

- leads to optimization where $MR(Q) = MC(Q)$ (assuming P>AC)

- Remember, the 'volume' benefit of increasing Q is countered by
    - Greater cost (producing more always costs more)
    - The need to reduce price (on all units) to get people to buy it


### Graphically: Monopoly profit-max {-}


```{r  fig.cap = '', out.width='60%', fig.asp=.4, fig.align='center',  echo = FALSE}
 knitr::include_graphics("picsfigs/monopprofit1.png")
```

\

```{r  fig.cap = '', out.width='60%', fig.asp=.4, fig.align='center',  echo = FALSE}
 knitr::include_graphics("picsfigs/monopprofit2.png")
```


```{block2,  type='note'}
Recall that a firm's revenue is Price $\times$ Quantity. This is depicted as a rectangle corresponding to a specific point on the demand curve facing the firm. \
The firm's *profit* is this revenue less average cost. \
MR tells you how the 'revenue rectangle' will increase (or decrease) with another unit. MC tells you the *cost* of this additional unit. \
Where MR>MC, increasing quantity a little bit increases revenue more than costs, thus increasing profit.
```

This is depicted in the figures below:

\

```{r  fig.cap = '', out.width='60%', fig.asp=.4, fig.align='center',  echo = FALSE}
 knitr::include_graphics("picsfigs/monopprofit3.png")
```

```{block2,  type='warning'}
Be careful here: \
The price the monopoly can get at quantity $Q^*$ is $P^*$  \
... to see the price charged you need to 'project up' to the *demand* curve NOT the MR curve.
```

\

```{r  fig.cap = '', out.width='60%', fig.asp=.4, fig.align='center',  echo = FALSE}
 knitr::include_graphics("picsfigs/monopprofit4.png")
```


Again, remember that revenue is $P^*Q^*$ but costs at $Q^*$ are $Q^* \times AC$ \
 so profit is $(P^*-AC)Q^*$. \

Again remember that the AC adds up the MC and the FC and divides by the quantity.



```{r  fig.cap = '', out.width='50%', fig.asp=.6, fig.align='center',  echo = FALSE}
 knitr::include_graphics("picsfigs/monopprofitmax.png")
```




## 'No supply curve for a monopoly'

A  'Supply curve': maps from p to q (and usually vice-versa) for a firm or industry


This is not *affected* by demand, only by costs and number of firms


<br> <br> \bigskip


In contrast:

A monopoly *chooses* price (thus also choosing quantity it can sell) where $MR(q)=mc(q)$

- But MR(q) depends on the demand curve slope/curvature at q,

- so if demand curve changes it will affect the supply/pricing decision


## The deadweight loss of monopoly


*Criticisms of monopoly:*

1. Monopolies produce too little output, the standard 'deadweight loss triangle'. This leads to *allocative inefficiency* (i.e., top-level inefficiency, i.e., the wrong mix of goods is being produced; too little of the monopolized good and too much of other goods).

2. There is a redistribution of wealth from consumers to owners of monopoly.

(But the latter could be counterbalanced by government redistribution; so maybe we shouldn't consider it a strike against monopoly?)


\

Compared to perfect competition, a monopoly typically produces less output and charges a higher price

- Some of the consumer surplus under perfect competition is transferred to the monopolist.

- There is also a deadweight loss under monopoly, as depicted below. This 'deadweight' is lost to society--- no one gets it. It represents net value that *could* be generated but is *not* generated.

\

```{r  fig.cap = '', out.width='65%', fig.asp=.4, fig.align='center',  echo = FALSE}
 knitr::include_graphics("picsfigs/dwl1.png")
```

\

*Be sure you understand and can depict*

The difference in monopoly vs perfect competitive quantity \
... difference in price \
... difference in consumer surplus \
... difference in firm profit or producer surplus

\

```{r  fig.cap = '', out.width='65%', fig.asp=.4, fig.align='center',  echo = FALSE}
 knitr::include_graphics("picsfigs/dwl2.png")
```

\

*Note:* The differences mentioned (costs, transfers) refer to the monopoly outcomes *relative to perfect competition*.

\

```{r  fig.cap = '', out.width='80%', fig.asp=.4, fig.align='center',  echo = FALSE}
 knitr::include_graphics("picsfigs/dwl3.png")
```

\

*Other criticisms:* Some argue the deadweight loss (DWL) above *understates* the true harm of monopoly. This is controversial. These arguments include

- 'Secure' monopolies don't innovate as much, and spend wastefully?

- Monopolies may expend wasteful resources (lobbying, threats, lawsuits...) to preserve barriers to entry

Thus the above monopoly profits may turn into *further* deadweight losses!

On the other side, some people argue monopolies tend not to persist in the long run, are disciplined by *potential* entry, and have *greater* incentives to innovate

\

Empirically, the magnitude of the social cost of monopoly is an open question. Estimates range from 0.5\% of GDP to 5\% of GDP

\

## Price discrimination: basics

Price Discrimination

:      The practice of firms offering different prices to different consumers

- Or different prices for slightly different *products* or quantities,
    - where the difference in price does *not* merely reflect cost difference,
    - with the goal of distinguishing consumers' *willingness to pay* (WTP).


*Note: This includes 'volume discounts', or offering an 'all you can eat' plan alongside a per-unit plan*

\

```{r  fig.cap = '', out.width='40%', fig.asp=.4, fig.align='center',  echo = FALSE}
 knitr::include_graphics("picsfigs/exeter_picturehouse.png")
```

Why such a complicated price list?

\

### Why do firms price discriminate? {-}

**It can increase profit...**  by 'extracting more surplus' from consumers


In general, for a monopoly firm, the ability to identify consumers based on their WTP and charge distinct prices *will* increase profit.

However, it may increase or decrease *social* (consumer+producer) surplus. Consumer surplus itself may increase or decrease.

\

### Uniform pricing (what we were previously considering... the usual analysis) {-}

Offering a single price for a good for all consumers is known as 'uniform pricing'.

\

This does not deal with differences amongst consumers. It may ''force the firm to target a particular group'', such as the wealthy, reducing its total sales.

Under monopoly, uniform pricing leads to a deadweight loss, as we have already seen:

```{r  fig.cap = '', out.width='70%', fig.asp=.4, fig.align='center',  echo = FALSE}
 knitr::include_graphics("picsfigs/dwl3.png")
```

\

However, price discrimination holds the potential to increase profit (it will, in general, increase profit). It might also reduce the deadweight loss, i.e., increase total welfare. If price discrimination is 'Perfect' then it *will* boost total welfare, as depicted below. (But if it is not perfect, it might reduce welfare...)


```{r  fig.cap = '', out.width='60%', fig.asp=.4, fig.align='center',  echo = FALSE}
 knitr::include_graphics("picsfigs/ppd1.png")
```

\

```{r  fig.cap = '', out.width='60%', fig.asp=.4, fig.align='center',  echo = FALSE}
 knitr::include_graphics("picsfigs/ppd2.png")
```

\

Price discrimination may seem counter-intuitive: ‘how can offering some consumers lower prices increase profit?’

- Higher prices increase your profit per unit, but at a higher price you will sell fewer units. The more you charge the less you sell.

- Some groups of ‘less keen’ consumers are very sensitive to the price, and they will buy very little at a high price, so a lower price would be more profitable.

- Some groups of ‘more keen’ consumers will buy a lot even at a high price. They are less ‘price-sensitive’, so you want to charge them more.

\

### The three types of price discrimination {-}

1. Individual-based (First degree; at best 'perfect')

\



Note that 'targeting a price at each consumer' may be done on the internet or on a discretionary basis by an individual seller.  But this alone does not imply Perfect price discrimination.

'Perfect' means the seller exactly predicts and charges each consumer her exact valuation! It's basically a theoretical ideal.


<br> <br> \bigskip


2. Self-selection (Second degree)

\


For 'self-selection' or 'second-degree price discrimination... we can imagine that  the firm doesn't know each consumer's valuations.  Or, perhaps the firm is not allowed to 'discriminate' by charging different prices to different people.

\

Instead, it sells different bundles, quantities or qualities of products to get high and low-value consumers to separate themselves...
 E.g., first-class seats.

 <br> <br> \bigskip

```{block2,  type='technote'}
To fully analyse these problems we need to know the techniques of 'mechanism design under asymmetric information', which we are not covering in this module.
```


```{block2,  type='note'}

 To fully analyse these problems we need to know the techniques of 'mechanism design under asymmetric information'; we will touch on this later in the module, time permitting

There are some interesting results, such as 'the firm finds it optimal to make the low(er)-valuing type/types' bundle smaller or lower-quality than would be efficient (called quality or quantity distortion), while the higher-valuing type gets a 'rent' (consumer surplus).

```


<br> <br> \bigskip


3. Group-based (Third degree; 'market separation')


Here the firm finds something identifiable and inherent about the consumer  that is indicative of her likely valuations (and price-sensitivity). \
It might be her age, nationality, student-status, or even perhaps her income.


\

## First-degree and/or 'perfect' price discrimination

- The firm can offer each individual a different price for each unit they purchase.

- Assuming you know what the consumer is willing to pay, you can make the *highest possible profit*; that is called ‘perfect’ price discrimination.


<br> <br> \bigskip


Perfect price discrimination
:     Charging each consumer (for each unit) the *maximum* he or she would be willing to pay, i.e., her valuation


<br> <br> \bigskip


Here the monopolist would extract *all the available surplus*; no consumer surplus remains.

Because the monopolists extracts *all* the possible surplus, this is efficient!  This holds because the monopolist captures:

$\max$(total value of good - cost) $\rightarrow$ max(CS+PS)

\

But perfect PD is a rare/impossible extreme: requires mind reading.

A possible close example: a website targets an individualised price to each consumer, based on clues like time-of-day, web clicks, cookie data, IP location. But even this is not really *perfect* price discrimination:
Here, the seller does not really know exactly what the consumer is willing to pay; he is using broad clues.[See Shiller, B. R. (2013, or updated version). First degree price discrimination using big data.]

```

\


```{r  fig.cap = '', out.width='70%', fig.asp=.4, fig.align='center',  echo = FALSE}
 knitr::include_graphics("picsfigs/ppd5.png")
```


\

## Second-degree price discrimination

Here the firm is unable to differentiate between consumers explicitly.

Instead it offers various varieties and bundles. It uses variations in quality/quantity to get consumers to "self-select."

Some examples:

- Quality- Transport- Different classes, Supermarkets- budget products

- Quantity- Supermarkets- Larger quantities at lower prices per unit; i.e., 'nonlinear pricing'


\

Consider...

**Quantity**

An 8 ounce cup of coffee for £1.60 vs. 16 ounces for £2.00

- 20 p per oz vs. 12.5p per oz.  (with linear pricing there would be the same price of 15p/oz.)

\

$\rightarrow$  Result: with 2 prices monopoly can get 'high value' consumers to buy/get more in total without losing 'low-value' consumers


\
\



**Quality**

The calculations are similar when we consider variations in quality:

An airline doesn't  know whom the high-valuation flyers are (willingness-to-pay, 'wtp' for travel *itself* varies)

But it may know on *average* that flyers with higher wtp for travel *also* value comfort more. Thus:

- Make second-class seats very uncomfortable, first-class luxurious, and charge more for first-class seats

- Can get consumers with higher values for travel *and* comfort to pay more

- ...without losing lower-valuing customers



\

### The 'self-selection' problem {-}

Train companies must price first and second class such that consumers will self-select.

- If first class is too expensive then the high valuing group will not choose first class

- If second-class is too cheap, both the high and low groups will choose second class

- But if second class is too expensive, the low groups will not buy a ticket.

```

^[The Third-Class Carriage is a c. 1862–1864 oil on canvas painting by Honoré Daumier]


```{block2,  type='digression'}

Jules Dupuit’s 1849 comments of the railroad industry in France:

> It is not because of the few thousand francs which have to be spent to put a roof over the third-class carriages or to upholster the third class seats that some company or other has open carriages with wooden benches. What the company is trying to do is to prevent the passengers who pay the second class fare from traveling third class; it hits the poor, not because it wants to hurt them, but to frighten the rich.

```


<br> <br> \bigskip


There is typically Lots of discussion of this in the media, see e.g.,

[THIS](https://www.1843magazine.com/ideas/the-daily/why-companies-make-their-products-worse) article in The Economist

\

## Third-degree price discrimination (3dpd) / Market separation

Third-degree price discrimination/Market-separation
:    The practice of charging different prices to different groups that can be identified

Here, the firm can differentiate *groups of consumers* or 'local markets', not individuals.

Each group has a different willingness to pay *on average*.

\

$\rightarrow$ Offer lower prices to lower-valuing groups, higher prices to higher-valuing groups.

\

**Example:** Students and old-age-pensioners may face lower prices for transport, food and other goods; as they have a lower willingness to pay for these

Remember: this is *not* done out of charity but to boost profits.

\

### Pricing under 3dpd/market separation (calculations/graphical depiction) {-}

Each group or market has it's own demand $\rightarrow$ marginal revenue curve

- So set an optimising price quantity *separately* for each group.

- E.g., a discount for the elderly, higher price for the middle-aged

- Or a lower price in Portugal than in Germany

```{r  fig.cap = '', out.width='50%', fig.asp=.4, fig.align='center',  echo = FALSE}

```

\

```

\

## Who benefits from 3DPD?

- Consumers *in identifiable group* with lower wtp face lower prices, thus they benefit

- Consumers *in identifiable group* with higher wtp face higher prices, thus they lose

- Firms can charge higher prices to high-wtp group without losing low-wtp group $\rightarrow$ increase profit


<br> <br> \bigskip


Net welfare result: theoretically uncertain. This is a nuanced point, but I think you are up to the challenge! This is *not* covered in the NS text, but I give several explanations and references.


\

**For consumers:**

```{r  fig.cap = '', out.width='70%', fig.asp=.4, fig.align='center',  echo = FALSE}
 knitr::include_graphics("picsfigs/pdwelfare.png")
```

\

```{r  fig.cap = '', out.width='75%', fig.asp=.4, fig.align='center',  echo = FALSE}
 knitr::include_graphics("picsfigs/pdwelfareoverall.png")
```


\


### Why is the benefit uncertain? {-}

**Exchange efficiency**

When groups can be identified as 'low and high valuation'

- the high-valuation groups get charged more, and thus consume less

- low-valuation groups get charged less, and consume more

$\rightarrow$ Exchange efficiency: *given what is produced*, PD causes it to be consumed by people who value it relatively less!

\

**Top-level efficiency; amount produced**

On the other hand, PD could lead more to be produced/consumed (but not necessarily) of the otherwise underproduced 'monopolised' good (remember DWL of monopoly)

$\rightarrow$ top-level efficiency may increase (or decrease)

\

E.g., suppose that with a 'uniform price' only the wealthy went to a restaurant...

- after PD (early-bird discounts, OAP discounts, benefits discounts) the low-income may also dine in the restaurant

- $\rightarrow$ more value is produced

\

Considering the two effects on efficiency just described ... one (Exchange efficiency) is negative and the other (Top-level) may be positive or negative. If the latter is positive (if production increases with PD) the effects trade off one another. Because the 'Exchange efficiency effect' is negative, the quantity produced *must* increase after PD for it to be beneficial. But this quantity increase is a necessary but not a sufficient condition; this effect also must be large enough to *outweigh* the exchange-efficiency effect.

\


## Arbitrage ...  can foil price discrimination

If, e.g., elderly who get discounts could sell the products to the middle-aged...

- Then middle-aged would always ask them to do this, never pay high prices

- Firm could no longer profit from this

- Similar issues with quantity discounts, or 'web cookie' personalised pricing

<br> <br> \bigskip

So PD only 'works' for goods that are hard to trade, like haircuts...

or where purchases are frequent and low-value, and resale markets are difficult



(The above issues are sometimes referred to as 'transactions costs'.)

```{block2,  type='warning'}
When I ask about the welfare effect of price discrimination, students often mention arbitrage in this discussion. However, the potential for arbitrage doesn't make price discrimination *inefficient*, it just makes it *ineffectual* and makes firms not want to bother.

```

This yields another mechanism design 'hidden information' 'principal-agent problem'



## Some practice problems


NS Problem 11.1

Plus:

d. In under 30 words and making reference to your diagram, explain why this deadweight loss would be avoided if the firm could perfectly price-discriminate.


\

## David's (old) new idea: A policy tool

People with low-incomes tend to have lower-wtp for most goods. \

Government can typically identify and verify incomes. \

Thus governments could allow and encourage low-income consumers to get an ID indicating this. \

Governments could allow and encourage firms to use this for price-discrimination
\

*But should they do so?*


\

- Firms would increase profit
- Low-income households would benefit, reducing inequality
- Net impact on efficiency uncertain; worth investigating

See the readings on this:  'The Government may want to encourage price discrimination by income' [linked here](https://davidreinstein.wordpress.com/research-and-publications/)

## Natural monopolies and regulation (very brief!)


Where an industry involves a 'natural monopoly' (IRS) the most efficient production is a unified production process
\

But if a monopoly reigns it overcharges and underprovides. Thus the government may want to allow/enforce monopoly privileges but *regulate* price it can charge

\
The difficulty in doing this: Government wants to regulate $p=AC$, but it doesn't know firms' actual cost function (asymmetric information).
The firm wants government to think it is high cost, to justify a high price.

\


This yields another mechanism design 'hidden information' 'principal-agent problem'


## Brief notes on imperfect competition

With multiple firms in the same market but not complete 'free entry', theory predicts a range of possible outcomes.

1. Collusion: 'Patient' firms may collude to establish the monopoly price, or any price above the competitive price
\



*Note:* This relates to the indefinitely-repeated prisoner's dillemma (covered under Game Theory)


<br> <br> \bigskip

2. 'Cournot' competition, firms choose quantities: This model predicts an intermediate price, between the competitive and monopoly prices


Note: You can look into some cool Cournot results like markups equals the inverse elasticity of demand divided by the number of firms.

*Note:* The related 'Stackleberg' model lets one firm choose first -- it will have a 'first-mover advantage' but still prices are intermediate
\

<br> <br> \bigskip


3. 'Bertrand' competition in prices: Predicts firms compete price down to the competitive (MC) level

\

<br> <br> \bigskip


4. Product differentiation, monopolistic competition; may lead to zero long-run profits



```{block2,  type='note'}
**Monopolistic Competition**

\

When firms can differentiate their products from one another this may reduce competition. each firm acts as a 'local' monopoly over it's own unique product. with free entry, however, firms introduce new products which shift the demand curves inwards for the other products (substitutes), until no firm is making long run profits.

```
